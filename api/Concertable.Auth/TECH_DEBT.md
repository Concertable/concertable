# Concertable.Auth — Technical Debt

---

## LOW

### E2E client identity and scopes are duplicated as contextual magic strings

`Concertable.Testing.E2E/TestTokenMinter.cs` posts the literal client id `concertable-test` and the literal
scope set `concertable.b2b.api concertable.customer.api concertable.search.api`, while Auth independently
registers the matching test client and API resources. The harness and authority can therefore drift with
no compile-time signal: renaming a client or scope in Auth leaves the test helper compiling but unable to
mint tokens. The shared harness should not solve this by depending on Auth runtime internals.

**Resolves when:** one Auth-owned contract/configuration source defines the client ids and scope names,
and both Auth registration and external consumers such as `TestTokenMinter` reuse it.

**Progress:** `Concertable.Auth.Contracts.ClientIds.Test` and the new `ApiScopeIds` class now define the
test client id and the three API scope names. `Concertable.Auth.Contracts` is a published, feed-pinned
package consumed everywhere by `PackageReference` — including by Auth's own `Config.cs` — so this addition
had to land and publish on its own before any consumer could reference it; wiring `Config.cs` and
`TestTokenMinter.cs` onto the new constants is the follow-up once the bumped pin reaches both.
