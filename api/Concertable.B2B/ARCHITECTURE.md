# Concertable.B2B — Architecture

> Cross-service design rationale and decision history: the `microservices-architecture` skill
> Internal module rules: the `dotnet-standards:module-structure` and `dotnet:module-structure` skills
> Outstanding gaps: [`TECH_DEBT.md`](./TECH_DEBT.md)

## Bounded context

B2B owns the venue/artist side of Concertable: opportunities, applications, bookings, contracts, concert workflow, settlement, and manager/admin profiles. The concert here is a **workflow entity** (`Posted → Applied → Accepted → Verified → Finished → Settled`) with contract terms and settlement obligations. B2B does **not** own ticket buyers, customer reviews, or browse/search — those belong to Customer and Search respectively.

---

## Host topology

| Project | Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Concertable.B2B.Web` | ASP.NET Core HTTP host | All controllers + ASB event consumers (in-process). Composition root. |
| `Concertable.B2B.Workers` | Azure Functions isolated | Background jobs. Currently: `ConcertFinishedFunction` (hourly timer). Uses **in-memory transport** — see TECH_DEBT. |
| `Concertable.B2B.DataAccess` | Shared csproj | Shared data-access primitives: tenant query filters, the per-stance DbContext base classes, and repositories. |
| `Concertable.B2B.AppHost` | Aspire AppHost | Local-dev orchestrator only. |

**Database:** `B2BDb` (SQL Server). Artist, Venue, and Concert each use a tenant-bound tracked/write
`<Module>DbContext` plus a tenant-independent read-only `<Module>ReadDbContext`. Conversations also has
`ConversationsPrivilegedDbContext` for tenant-independent administrative (moderation) writes.

---

## Modules

All modules live under `Modules/`. Each follows the `Concertable.B2B.<Module>.*` naming convention.

| Module | Canonical entities | Projects |
|---|---|---|
| **Artist** | `ArtistEntity` | Api, Application, Contracts, Domain, Infrastructure, IntegrationTests |
| **Concert** | `ConcertEntity` (workflow: stage, BookingId; deal type derives through Booking → Application), `OpportunityEntity`, `ApplicationEntity`, `BookingEntity`, `SettlementTransactionEntity`, `TicketTransactionEntity` | Api, Application, Contracts, Domain, Infrastructure, IntegrationTests, UnitTests |
| **Contract** | `DealEntity` (TPH: `FlatFeeDealEntity`, `DoorSplitDealEntity`, `VersusDealEntity`, `VenueHireDealEntity`), `EscrowEntity` | Api, Application, Contracts, Domain, Infrastructure, UnitTests |
| **Conversations** | `MessageEntity`, `ParticipantProfile` (local sender-display projection) | Api, Application, Contracts, Domain, Infrastructure |
| **Tenant** | `TenantEntity` (business account, membership boundary, legal/VAT/Stripe identity, settlement payee) | Api, Application, Contracts, Domain, Infrastructure, IntegrationTests, UnitTests |
| **User** | `UserEntity` (flat) + standalone `AdminProfileEntity` — no TPH, no manager-profile subtypes | Api, Application, Contracts, Domain, Infrastructure, IntegrationTests |
| **Venue** | `VenueEntity`, `VenueImageEntity`, `PayoutAccountEntity` | Api, Application, Contracts, Domain, Infrastructure, IntegrationTests |

Cross-module calls go through `IXModule` facades in `Concertable.B2B.<Module>.Contracts` only. No direct entity reach-in between modules.

`Tenant` is the canonical backend concept. In the current one-to-one model it is both the isolation boundary and the business/legal account; there is no separate organisation aggregate or identifier. Artist and Venue are tenant-owned marketplace profiles. Organisation wording belongs only at presentation boundaries.

## Integration events

All event types implement `IIntegrationEvent` from `Concertable.Messaging.Contracts`. Transport: Azure Service Bus (`concertable-b2b` service name, `event-` topic prefix). Wired in `Concertable.B2B.Web/Program.cs`.

### Published

| Event | Defined in | When raised |
|---|---|---|
| `ArtistChangedEvent` | `Concertable.B2B.Artist.Contracts.Events` | Artist profile updated |
| `ArtistRatingUpdatedEvent` | `Concertable.B2B.Artist.Contracts.Events` | Rating projection updated |
| `VenueChangedEvent` | `Concertable.B2B.Venue.Contracts.Events` | Venue profile updated |
| `VenueRatingUpdatedEvent` | `Concertable.B2B.Venue.Contracts.Events` | Rating projection updated |
| `ConcertChangedEvent` | `Concertable.B2B.Concert.Contracts.Events` | Concert edited / stage changed |
| `ConcertPostedEvent` | `Concertable.B2B.Concert.Contracts.Events` | Concert moves to Posted stage |
| `ConcertRatingUpdatedEvent` | `Concertable.B2B.Concert.Contracts.Events` | Rating projection updated |

The B2B host also dispatches published integration events to registered local handlers. Conversations consumes `ArtistChangedEvent` and `VenueChangedEvent` locally to maintain its `ParticipantProfile` projection keyed by `TenantId`; sender rendering never reaches into Artist or Venue storage synchronously.

### Consumed

| Event | Source | Handler(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `CredentialRegisteredEvent` | Auth | `CredentialRegisteredHandler` (User module — creates the role-agnostic user projection and the surviving admin profile) |
| `CustomerReviewSubmittedEvent` | Customer | `ArtistReviewProjectionHandler`, `VenueReviewProjectionHandler`, `ConcertReviewProjectionHandler` |
| `PaymentSucceededEvent` | Payment | `SettlementPaymentProcessor`, `EscrowPaymentProcessor`, `VerifyPaymentProcessor`, `TicketSaleProcessor` |
| `PaymentFailedEvent` | Payment | `BookingPaymentFailedProcessor`, `VerifyPaymentFailedProcessor` |

All consumed events use `InboxMessageEntity` deduplication keyed by `(MessageId, ConsumerName)`.

---

## Sync calls out

| Target | Client | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `Concertable.Payment` | `Concertable.Payment.Client` | Create payment intents, transfers, refunds, payout account ops |
| `Concertable.Auth` | JWT Bearer middleware | Token validation; `client_credentials` for service-to-service tokens |

No sync calls to Customer or Search. B2B and Customer communicate **exclusively via bus events**.

---

## Authentication

- JWT Bearer, audience `concertable.b2b.api`
- `client_credentials` client: `concertable-b2b`, scope `payment:write`
- **No role claims in tokens.** B2B tokens are identity-only (`sub` + `email`); acting authority is the request-scoped active tenant (`X-Tenant-Id` → membership `TenantRole`), never a token claim.

---

## Internal architecture

B2B is a modular monolith *inside* the service. The `dotnet-standards:module-structure` and `dotnet:module-structure` skills apply verbatim:

- Cross-module calls: `IXModule` facade only (in `<Module>.Contracts`)
- Per-module `XDbContext` with its own schema; all point at `B2BDb`
- Intra-service events: in-process `IEventRaiser` + `XChangedDomainEvent` — no bus involvement
- Module-owned `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>` in `<Module>.Infrastructure/Data/Configurations/`
- Per-module `IDevSeeder` / `ITestSeeder`
- `InternalsVisibleTo` chains; module Application interfaces stay `internal`

The bus (`AddAzureServiceBusTransport`) is for **cross-service** events only. Intra-B2B flows that currently round-trip ASB are flagged in TECH_DEBT.

## What is NOT in this service

| Concern | Lives in |
|---|---|
| Ticket sales, ticket entities | `Concertable.Customer` |
| Customer reviews (`ReviewEntity`) | `Concertable.Customer` |
| Customer profile / preferences | `Concertable.Customer` |
| Browse / autocomplete / search reads | `Concertable.Search` |
| Stripe API keys, webhook receiver | `Concertable.Payment` |
| Identity authority (`sub`, password hash, email verification) | `Concertable.Auth` |
