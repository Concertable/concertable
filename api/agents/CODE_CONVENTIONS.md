# Code Conventions

Injected collaborators default to interface-typed dependencies and interface-to-implementation DI registrations; use a concrete type only when an interface adds literally no value or actively makes an established pattern worse.

## Private fields — no underscore prefix

Use `this.field` disambiguation in constructors instead of `_field` prefixes.

```csharp
// CORRECT
private readonly SearchDbContext context;

public MyService(SearchDbContext context)
{
    this.context = context;
}

// WRONG
private readonly SearchDbContext _context;

public MyService(SearchDbContext context)
{
    _context = context;
}
```

**Constructor assignments are always `this.`-qualified** — fields *and* public auto-properties. When a
member is a surfaced public auto-property (see the dependency-holder pattern in
[`CODE_PATTERNS.md`](./CODE_PATTERNS.md)), still write `this.Property = param`, not a bare
`Property = param`. Uniform `this.` at every assignment site reads consistently and makes the
member-vs-param split obvious at a glance.

## No `string.Empty` as a "populated later" default — use `null!`

A non-nullable `string` property that something else populates (deserialization DTOs, EF entities, config-bound options, audit interceptors) defaults to `null!`, never `string.Empty`. An empty-string default masks a missing value as a present-but-blank one; `null!` says plainly "something else assigns this before use".

Where an empty string is the genuine runtime value (a fallback in `??` / `GetValueOrDefault`, a log fragment), `string.Empty` is correct — keep it. Never the `""` literal.

```csharp
// CORRECT — populated by the deserializer
public string LongName { get; init; } = null!;

// CORRECT — empty string is the real fallback value
var type = metadata.GetValueOrDefault("type", string.Empty);

// WRONG — placeholder default pretending to be a value
public string LongName { get; init; } = string.Empty;
```

## No primary constructors for captured state

Captured constructor parameters — anything read by a method or property — must be explicit `private readonly` fields assigned via `this.field = param`, never primary-constructor captures. This covers services, repositories, handlers, and validators, and any base class that uses its dependencies (e.g. the `TenantScopedDbContext` / `AdminDbContext` bases, whose `provider` and `defaultSchema` are read in `OnModelCreating`).

A constructor that only forwards its parameters to `base(...)` and captures nothing may use a primary constructor — there is no field to make `readonly`, so the shorthand is the clearest spelling. The pure base-forwarder leaf DB contexts (e.g. `VenueDbContext`, `VenueAdminDbContext`) are the standing example.

## Repositories — depend on the matching context capability

The shared `Concertable.DataAccess.Infrastructure` implementations mirror the context and repository
capability hierarchies:

```text
IReadDbContext  -> IReadRepository<TEntity, TKey>  -> ReadRepository<TEntity, TKey>
IWriteDbContext -> IWriteRepository<TEntity>      -> WriteRepository<TEntity>
IDbContext      -> IRepository<TEntity, TKey>      -> Repository<TEntity, TKey>
```

The shared bases deliberately have no concrete `TContext` parameter. Their protected `Context`
properties expose only the matching `IReadDbContext`, `IWriteDbContext`, or `IDbContext` capability.

A module may keep a local `Repository<TEntity>` alias to bind its normal concrete context and key type
(`int` + `IIdEntity` for most modules, `Guid` + `IGuidEntity` for User/Tenant). Its constructor accepts
the concrete module context and forwards it to the context-free shared base:

```csharp
internal abstract class Repository<TEntity>(TenantDbContext context)
    : Repository<TEntity, Guid>(context)
    where TEntity : class, IGuidEntity;
```

Keep a module-local `ReadRepository<TEntity>` or `WriteRepository<TEntity>` alias only when concrete
repositories actually derive from it. A standalone read or write contract uses the matching shared
base; a combined CRUD contract uses `Repository<TEntity, TKey>`.

A concrete repository implements the module's `IXRepository`, which extends the matching shared
interface, and needs **no members of its own** unless the module has extra queries.
`GetAll`/`GetById`/`Exists`/`Add`/`Update`/`Remove`/`SaveChanges` come from the combined base —
**never re-declare them** (not even a `CancellationToken` overload of `GetById`). Add only the extra
finders the base cannot express.

Use the inherited `Context` capability for generic entity queries. If a specialized repository needs
typed `DbSet` properties or EF-specific APIs such as `Entry`, `Database`, `ChangeTracker`, or bulk
operations, retain the concrete context in a private readonly `context` field on that repository:

```csharp
internal sealed class TenantRepository : Repository<TenantEntity>, ITenantRepository
{
    private readonly TenantDbContext context;

    public TenantRepository(TenantDbContext context) : base(context)
    {
        this.context = context;
    }

    public Task<TenantMembershipEntity?> FindMembershipAsync(Guid tenantId, Guid userId, CancellationToken ct = default) =>
        context.Memberships.FirstOrDefaultAsync(m => m.TenantId == tenantId && m.UserId == userId, ct);
}
```

The injected concrete context field is always named `context` (never `dbContext`) — see the
field-naming rule above. Do not retain it when the protected capability is sufficient, and do not
hand-roll a bare `IXRepository` that re-implements matching generic CRUD.

**Name a repository method for the query, a service method for the intent.** A repository
finder says literally what it fetches and by what key — `GetByTenantIdAsync`,
`GetUnreadCountByTenantIdAsync` — so the data access is obvious at the call site. The
use-case name (`GetInboxAsync`, `GetInboxSummaryAsync`) belongs on the *service* that calls
it. Don't push an intent name (`GetInbox`) down onto the repository.

**Adding one entity with nothing else staged — use `InsertAsync`, not `AddAsync` + `SaveChangesAsync`.**
`IWriteRepository<TEntity>` gives both: `AddAsync` stages only (for a unit of work that stages more than
one write before a single shared save), `InsertAsync` stages *and* saves in one call. When the add is the
only write happening in that method, `InsertAsync` is the one-line form — writing `repository.Add(x);
await repository.SaveChangesAsync(ct);` as the last two statements of a method is the same operation
spelled with an extra line and an extra round-trip to reason about.

```csharp
// CORRECT — the add is the only staged write in this method
await repository.InsertAsync(invitation, ct);

// WRONG — two calls for what InsertAsync already does in one
repository.Add(invitation);
await repository.SaveChangesAsync(ct);
```

Reach for the two-call `AddAsync` + `SaveChangesAsync` form only when something *else* is staged first
(another `Add`/`Update`/`Remove` in the same method) and the save is meant to commit all of it together.

**Active tenant is the default scope of B2B application services.** `ITenantContext` is the single
authority for the tenant selected by `X-Tenant-Id`. A controller does not accept or resolve a tenant
ID, and a repository does not independently interpret the active request. Name the ordinary scoped
use case for its domain intent (`GetDetailsAsync`, `CreateAsync`, `UpdateAsync`); name an alternative
capability explicitly (`GetDetailsByIdAsync`). Repository queries state the actual key
(`GetDetailsByTenantIdAsync(Guid tenantId, CancellationToken ct = default)`). Do not add profile-ID
resolver methods merely to turn the active tenant into an Artist or Venue ID. Tenant-owned queries
use `TenantId` directly, backed by a module-local projection when they cross a module boundary.

`CurrentUser`, `ForUser`, `Me`, and `Self` are reserved for data belonging to the authenticated human.
Do not add `ActiveTenant` to every ordinary B2B service method merely to restate its default scope.

**Every asynchronous application-service and repository method that can reach I/O accepts a
`CancellationToken ct = default`.** Pass it through every awaited framework or dependency call that
supports cancellation. Cancellation propagates as cancellation; it is never converted to a Result.

## Repository query outputs — `Projection` only names an intermediate query shape

Name a query-result type for the role it actually plays, not merely for the layer returning it:

- A repository returning a persistence entity or persisted event-fed read model returns that type directly.
- A repository returning the final meaningful application/read shape uses that shape's normal name. Do not add
  `Projection` merely because a repository materializes it.
- Use the `Projection` suffix only for an ephemeral `Select` shape that the service must map or enrich before
  returning its final result. Keep that type internal to the repository/application boundary.
- `Dto` and `Projection` are not synonyms. `Projection` describes an intermediate query shape; `Dto` identifies a
  data contract when that suffix genuinely disambiguates the type.
- If a repository and service return the same final type, do not introduce a throwaway mapping type. Keep the final
  type's own name, including `Dto` when that suffix is useful.
- Repositories never leak `IQueryable`. Filtering, aggregation, and projection stay in data access; type-to-type
  conversion or cross-module enrichment belongs in the service and an `XMappers` extension class.

## Table + schema names — the module `Schema.cs` constants

Each persistence module owns a `Schema.cs` (`internal static class Schema`) holding its DB schema name and
its table names as `const string`s — `Schema.Name` (e.g. `"concert"`) and `Schema.Tables.X` (e.g.
`Schema.Tables.Invoices`). EF configs reference these — `builder.ToTable(Schema.Tables.Invoices, Schema.Name)` —
never a bare string literal, so a renamed table changes one constant, not N scattered strings.

Column names need no equivalent: EF names each column after its property, so a config sets one only for a
deliberate rename (`HasColumnName("Period_Start")`) — and those few stay inline literals, not a constants class.

## Single-statement branches — no braces

```csharp
// CORRECT
if (condition)
    return;

// WRONG
if (condition)
{
    return;
}
```

## Empty blocks — compact braces

Write deliberately empty blocks with `{ }` on the same line:

```csharp
catch (OperationCanceledException) { }
```

## Optional parameters — don't add one that callers must skip with a named argument

An optional parameter earns its place only when call sites actually pass it *positionally* and naturally. The moment varying one argument forces a call site to name-skip past another —
`ApplyAsync(opportunityId, signatoryName: name)` to hop over an unwanted `paymentMethodId` — the optional has stopped paying for itself: the signature grew, the call got noisier, and nothing reads more clearly. Prefer, in order: vary the value **inline** at the one call site that needs it (especially in tests — a self-contained Arrange beats threading a knob through a shared helper), or add a small **focused overload/helper** for that shape. Only keep the extra optional when several call sites genuinely pass it the ordinary way.

```csharp
// WRONG — the named arg exists only to skip paymentMethodId; the knob serves one caller
private Task<int> ApplyAsync(int opportunityId, string? paymentMethodId = null, string signatoryName = "Test Signatory") ...
var id = await ApplyAsync(opportunityId, signatoryName: "Aretha Artist");

// CORRECT — the one caller that needs a distinct name just does the apply inline
await artistClient.PostAsync($"/api/Application/{opportunityId}", new { eSignature = new { signatoryName = "Aretha Artist" } });
```

## Base-class members — call through `base.`

When invoking a member that's inherited from a base class (not declared on the current type), qualify
the call with `base.`. It tells the reader at a glance that the member lives on the base, not in this
class, so they don't hunt for a definition that isn't here.

```csharp
// CORRECT — CurrentTenant is defined on TenantScopedRepository, not this repo
return await base.CurrentTenant.Where(v => v.IsActive).ToListAsync(ct);

// WRONG — reads like a local member
return await CurrentTenant.Where(v => v.IsActive).ToListAsync(ct);
```

## No comments on WHAT the code does

Only add a comment when the WHY is non-obvious (hidden constraint, subtle invariant, workaround for a specific bug). Never narrate what the code does — well-named identifiers already do that.

## Comments — default to none; mechanics here, policy in root `CLAUDE.md`

The repo-wide policy (default to zero, ≤2 lines, *why* lives in the commit message, and the disqualifiers — restating docs, citing transient artifacts, narrating the *what*) is in the root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md). The C#-mechanical part: a WHY-comment is one line where it can be → `//`; the rare genuinely-multi-line one → a single `/* */` block, never stacked `//` lines.

**Placement:** put the `//` on its own line directly above the statement, or inline after it with a single space — never pad with spaces to align comments into a column.

## Doc comments — XML `<summary>`, not `//`

Use these **sparingly** — don't pollute the codebase with summaries on self-explanatory types and members. Add one only where a developer (or an AI) reading the code later would genuinely benefit: real ambiguity, a non-obvious constraint, a safety/ordering subtlety, an API contract. A summary that just restates the name earns its deletion. The audience is whoever maintains the code next — write it for them.

**Don't document both an interface and its implementation.** The contract lives on the interface — that's the one place a summary belongs. The implementing class repeats nothing; leave it bare unless the *implementation itself* has a non-obvious quirk the interface can't speak to (a specific algorithm, a workaround). Two summaries saying the same thing is just drift waiting to happen.

When you *do* document a type or member, write it as an XML doc comment (`/// <summary>…</summary>`), not a `//` line comment. Reserve `//` for short inline notes *inside* method bodies. Cross-reference with `<see cref="…"/>` / `<see langword="null"/>` instead of bare prose, and use `<c>Name</c>` for a type the declaring assembly can't reference (avoids an unresolved-cref warning).

**Lead with what the thing *is*, in plain words** — "A snapshot of the deal, frozen at Accept." beats terse jargon like "Columns are copies, never references to the live deal". Name the kind-of-thing ("a snapshot of X", "a cache of X", "a guard that…"), then only the constraint that matters. Don't over-explain — a good "X of Y" opener usually carries it.

```csharp
// CORRECT — documents the member
/// <summary>
/// The owning tenant. Settable so <c>TenantInterceptor</c> can stamp it at SaveChanges; domain
/// code never sets it directly.
/// </summary>
Guid TenantId { get; set; }

// WRONG — docstring-style note as a line comment on a member
// Settable so the interceptor can stamp it
Guid TenantId { get; set; }
```

## Type-name suffixes — `Service` means "orchestrates a repository", not "a class I inject"

`Service` is the suffix that rots first: it gets used for anything injectable, and once a pure
value-producer is also called `Service`, the genuinely useful smell — *a service calling another
service* — stops being visible, because every collaborator looks the same at the injection site.

Pick the suffix from the type's **shape**, not from "it's registered in DI". Almost everything here is
DI'd; that fact carries no naming information.

| Suffix | The shape it claims | Precedent |
|---|---|---|
| `Service` | Orchestrates domain logic **over a repository**. Stateful collaborator, owns a unit of work. | `IVenueService`, `IInvitationService` |
| `Repository` | Domain-entity persistence via the module `DbContext`. | `ITenantRepository` |
| `Store` | Bytes/blobs in and out of a backing store, no domain logic. | `IUserStore` (ASP.NET Identity) |
| `Client` | A remote or third-party API. | `HttpClient`, `BlobServiceClient` |
| `Factory` | Creates **instances/components**, usually of a type family. | `IHttpClientFactory`, `ILoggerFactory` |
| `Generator` | Produces a **value/artifact** from inputs. | `LinkGenerator`, `RandomNumberGenerator` |
| `Builder` | **Mutable, stepwise** accumulation, terminated by `Build()`/a final property. | `StringBuilder`, `UriBuilder`, `WebApplicationBuilder` |
| `Provider` | Supplies a value or pluggable strategy, often one of several. | `IServiceProvider`, `IFileProvider`, `TimeProvider` |
| `Accessor` | Exposes an ambient/current value. | `IHttpContextAccessor` |
| `Handler` | Reacts to a message or event. | `IIntegrationEventHandler<T>` |
| `Helper` / `Utility` | **`static class` of pure functions.** No DI, no state, no config. | `WebUtility`, `HttpUtility` |

Two rules that follow from the table:

- **`Helper`/`Utility` is reserved for `static`.** It is not the escape hatch for "injected but not
  really a service" — an injected, config-bound collaborator gets a shape noun (`Generator`, `Factory`,
  `Store`). Note .NET is itself inconsistent here (`IUrlHelper` is injected), which is exactly why we
  pin the stricter meaning rather than inherit the ambiguity.
- **`Builder` vs `Generator` vs `Factory` is decided by mechanics, not vibes** — mutable-then-finalize is
  a `Builder`; one-shot value from inputs is a `Generator`; one-shot *component* is a `Factory`.

For types whose whole job is a single operation, [`CODE_PATTERNS.md`](./CODE_PATTERNS.md) already governs
the name — the agent-noun of that one method (`Mapper.Map`, `Resolver.Resolve`, `Calculator.Calculate`,
`Renderer.Render`, `Serializer.Serialize`). This table is the same rule widened to collaborator shapes.

Known violations awaiting a batched rename sweep are listed in [`../TECH_DEBT.md`](../TECH_DEBT.md);
don't add new ones.

## Validators — FluentValidation for input shape, Reunion `ValidationResult` for domain eligibility

Two different jobs get two different tools. Picking the wrong one produces either a hand-rolled worse
`MaximumLength`, or validation that silently runs twice.

**Input shape** — required, length, range, enum membership, format, per-property conditions — is a
FluentValidation `AbstractValidator<TRequest>`, registered in the module's composition root with
`AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<TValidator>(includeInternalTypes: true)`. How it is *invoked*
depends on how the input arrives, and this is the part that is easy to get wrong:

| The input arrives… | How it is validated |
|---|---|
| through an **MVC action** (`[FromBody]`/`[FromForm]`) | `AddFluentValidationAutoValidation()` is registered service-wide, so the filter rejects with a 400 `ValidationProblemDetails` **before the action runs**. Register the validator and stop — do not inject it. |
| **outside the MVC pipeline** — worker, timer job, integration/domain event handler, gRPC server method, internal `IXModule` call | Auto-validation is an MVC filter and never runs. Inject `IValidator<TRequest>`, call it explicitly, and map the failure into that operation's own carrier. |

Never inject `IValidator<T>` for a type that *also* reaches the same operation through an MVC action —
auto-validation has already rejected it, so the injected check is unreachable code and its error case is
an outcome the operation cannot produce.

**Domain eligibility** is the other job: a business precondition needing other aggregates, modules, or
the clock, which FluentValidation cannot express naturally. That is a hand-written validator returning
Reunion's `ValidationResult` — `Concertable.Customer.Ticket`'s `TicketValidator.CanBePurchased` (is the
concert posted, still in the future, not sold out) is the reference. Its result composes into the
operation's Result chain; it is not an HTTP concern and has no auto-validation equivalent.

Validator *files* stay named `XValidators` either way; the types inside keep their own shape
(`CreateVenueRequestValidator`, `TicketValidator`).

## Result pattern

Result, Option, typed-error, validation carriers, construction, composition, testing, and
transport-terminal conventions live in [RESULT_PATTERN.md](./RESULT_PATTERN.md). It is the sole source
of truth for those; do not add Result-pattern rules here. The validator *tool choice* above is a
separate concern and lives here.

## DTO naming — `Response` is HTTP-only; `Dto` is an intentional disambiguator

The `Response` suffix is reserved for the **HTTP-API wire layer** (`Module.Api/Responses/`, see the
"DTOs vs Responses" section in [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)). It does **not** belong on the C#
service/client DTOs that adapters (gRPC clients, service interfaces) pass around:

- **`Result<TValue, TError>`** is already the service-call wrapper — the "did it succeed" envelope.
  Naming the payload `XResponse` on top of `Result<XResponse, XError>` double-encodes "this is a
  reply".
- **Service and client payloads do not mechanically gain or lose `Dto`.** Keep the suffix when it
  usefully distinguishes a data shape from the same-named entity or domain concept (`OpportunityDto`);
  omit it when the payload name is already unambiguous (`Transfer`, `Refund`, `EscrowDeposit`,
  `PaymentOutcome`). Accept an SDK name collision (`Stripe.Transfer`, `Stripe.Refund`) and resolve it
  with a `using` alias in the few files that need both
  (`using Transfer = Concertable.Payment.Contracts.Transfer;`).
- **Proto message names stay `*Response`.** `EscrowResponse`/`PaymentResponse` in a `.proto` are the
  native gRPC RPC vocabulary — wire-only, generated, and never surfaced as the C# payload. The client- and
  server-side `XMappers` map proto `*Response` ⇄ the C# payload.

```csharp
// CORRECT — unambiguous service/client payloads need no suffix
Task<Result<EscrowDeposit, DepositError>> DepositAsync(...);
Task<Result<Transfer, ReleaseError>> ReleaseAsync(...);

// CORRECT — Dto distinguishes the data shape from the Opportunity entity/concept
Task<Result<OpportunityDto, OpportunityError>> GetByIdAsync(int id);

// WRONG — Response suffix on a non-HTTP DTO, redundant with typed Result
Task<Result<EscrowResponse, DepositError>> DepositAsync(...);
```

## Mappers — `XMappers` extension methods

Type-to-type mapping (e.g. gRPC proto ⇄ domain/contract types) lives in a static `XMappers` class as extension methods named `ToTarget()`, not as private `MapX` helpers on the consumer.

```csharp
internal static class EscrowMappers
{
    public static EscrowDeposit ToEscrowDeposit(this Proto.EscrowResponse r) => ...;
    public static EscrowStatus ToEscrowStatus(this Proto.EscrowStatusType s) => ...;
}
```

## Pure operations — extensions for receiver-owned behaviour, named evaluators for policy

A pure operation belongs on an extension when one receiver clearly owns the transformation or question.
Use the shortest unambiguous domain name: `value.ToDto()`, `observation.ToNormalized()`,
`state.IsTerminal()`. Keep a receiver's related extensions together in one `XExtensions` class or the
domain mapping family's `XMappers` class; do not scatter them across unrelated helpers.

A decision over two or more peer inputs does not belong to either receiver. Keep the policy visible at
the call site behind an operation-specific static type such as `TransitionEvaluator.Evaluate(current,
observation)`. Do not use `Specification` for an evaluator; in this codebase that name is reserved for
query/specification-pattern semantics.

Represent a closed, deterministic key-to-value table once with `FrozenDictionary` or `FrozenSet` when
the entries are data rather than behaviour. This includes enum translations, provider-status
normalization, fixed error definitions, and legal transition edges. Use guarded code when the outcome
depends on contextual validation or calculation. Do not create parallel frozen maps for the same key
family; the validated keyed-strategy registry rule in `CODE_PATTERNS.md` remains authoritative there.

## Paginated results — project with `IPagination<T>.Map`, never `new Pagination<T>(...)`

Mapping a page from entity to DTO, or DTO to Response, is one call:

```csharp
return (await reportRepository.GetQueueAsync(pageParams)).Map(r => r.ToDto());
```

`Map` lives in `Concertable.Contracts` beside `IPagination<T>`, so every layer can reach it — including
`*.Api`, which deliberately does not reference the data-access package. It carries
`TotalCount`/`PageNumber`/`PageSize` across for you; hand-writing `new Pagination<TDestination>(...)`
restates four arguments that have exactly one correct value.

Two cases are **not** `Map`:

- **Only the item type widens** — `IPagination<out T>` is covariant, so an `IPagination<ArtistHeader>`
  already *is* an `IPagination<IHeader>`. Return it; don't re-wrap and don't `Map(x => x)`.
- **The projection is asynchronous** — `Map` takes a synchronous selector, so an `await`-ing projection
  (`OpportunityMapper.ToDtosAsync`) still constructs its page by hand.

## `#region` — sparingly, to group same-shaped members in an aggregating file

The codebase does **not** use `#region` in ordinary classes — it hides code and usually signals a class
that should be split. It earns its place in exactly one shape: a single file that legitimately
**aggregates many same-shaped members**, where grouping by owner/subject is the only practical way to
navigate.

The canonical case is a project's `Log.cs` — one file holding every `[LoggerMessage]` method for the
project — partitioned into `#region`s named for the **class/service that emits them**
(`#region EscrowService`, `#region WebhookProcessor`). Name the region for the thing it groups, never a
generic label. If a class *isn't* an aggregator of one member shape, don't reach for `#region` — split
it instead.

(Test classes have the analogous rule — region by method-under-test — in
[`UNIT_CONVENTIONS.md`](./UNIT_CONVENTIONS.md) / [`INTEGRATION_CONVENTIONS.md`](./INTEGRATION_CONVENTIONS.md).)

## Logging — source-generated `Log.cs`

No inline `logger.LogInformation/LogWarning/LogError(...)`. Each project owns one `Log.cs` (`internal static partial class Log`) with a `[LoggerMessage]` method per message; call `logger.PublishedVenueEvents(count)`. Source-gen gates on `IsEnabled(level)` so switched-off levels cost nothing.

```csharp
[LoggerMessage(Level = LogLevel.Information, Message = "Published {Count} venue events")]
internal static partial void PublishedVenueEvents(this ILogger logger, int count);
```

## Extension members — C# 14 `extension()` blocks, not `this`

New extension members go in `extension(Receiver)` blocks — one `XExtensions` static class per receiver type
(`EnvironmentsExtensions` extends `Environments`; `HostEnvironmentExtensions` extends `IHostEnvironment`). This is
the modern unified form (it also does properties/indexers/static members and groups by receiver). Never add a new
legacy `public static … (this X x)` method; the existing ones await a migration sweep ([`../TECH_DEBT.md`](../TECH_DEBT.md)).

## Geometry — use IGeometryProvider

Inject `[FromKeyedServices(GeometryProviderType.Geographic)] IGeometryProvider geometryProvider` for WGS84 point creation. Never instantiate `GeometryFactory` or `new Point(...)` directly.

```csharp
var location = geometryProvider.CreatePoint(e.Latitude, e.Longitude);
```
