## Findings

- [x] **SEC1 — MEDIUM — security** — `api/Concertable.B2B/tests/E2ETests/Concertable.B2B.E2ETests.Server/E2EAdminExtensions.cs:25`
  Admin-key validation fails open when `E2E:AdminKey` is blank: an absent request header is also an empty byte sequence, so `FixedTimeEquals` succeeds and exposes the destructive reset endpoint. The same defect exists in the Customer and Payment E2E admin modules. Reject blank keys at startup, reject missing/blank headers before comparison, require the E2E host environment before registering or mapping the endpoints, and add regression coverage for blank configuration and an absent header.

- [x] **MB1 — HIGH — module boundary** — `api/Concertable.Shared/tests/Concertable.Testing.E2E/FleetProfile.cs:5`
  `FleetSurface`, `FleetProfile`, and `IFleetProjectProvider` name B2B and Customer inside `Concertable.Testing.E2E`, violating that project's rule: “This project is SERVICE-AGNOSTIC. Nothing service-specific goes here. Ever.” Move the fleet-specific composition contracts and source-provider factory into a fleet-owned project, and keep the shared harness APIs generic over endpoint values and project metadata.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-30

Range reviewed: `89f4962..abf045a` (2 commits).

- [x] **CV1 — MEDIUM — test convention** — `api/Concertable.B2B/tests/Concertable.B2B.E2EAdmin.UnitTests/E2EAdminSecurityTests.cs:10`
  The three new `E2EAdmin.UnitTests` suites directly exercise guard clauses and internal authorization helpers, contrary to the unit-testing rule “Do not add a unit test merely to cover a guard clause” and its requirement that endpoint/host wiring use the integration tier. Replace them with service-local integration coverage that boots the E2E admin route on a test host, proves missing/blank keys fail closed over HTTP/startup, and remove the internal-only unit-test exposure.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-30 (final fix pass)

Range reviewed: `abf045a..a3a8548` (1 commit).

- [x] **NAT1 — MEDIUM — native** — `api/Concertable.Payment/tests/Concertable.Payment.E2EAdmin.UnitTests/E2EAdminSecurityTests.cs:1`
  The Payment unit-test source was left orphaned when its project moved to `E2EAdmin.IntegrationTests`, so the obsolete internal-helper tests silently stopped compiling instead of being removed as CV1 required. Delete the stale file and now-empty unit-test directory, then verify no `E2EAdmin.UnitTests` paths remain.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-30 (cleanup pass)

Range reviewed: `a3a8548..3c4255e` (1 commit).

No new findings. Native correctness and security coverage were both clean; the deletion retained equivalent Payment integration coverage and left no stale `E2EAdmin.UnitTests` paths.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-30 (main sync)

Range reviewed: `3c4255e..5fa21cb` (23 commits, including the current `origin/main` merge).

No new findings. Native correctness, repository boundary/convention, and security review were clean. The sole merge conflict was regenerated inventory; source-mode and package-only carve builds both passed against platform version `0.1.0-alpha.0.1267`.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-30 (CI verifier repair)

Range reviewed: `3bf078f..755f3a1` (1 commit).

No new findings. Native correctness, error handling, boundary, convention, and test-coverage lenses were clean. The change preserves the exact-one and version checks for projects that resolve `Concertable.DataAccess.Infrastructure` while allowing host-only integration projects to omit that package. No security-sensitive path changed, so the security layer was not required for this range.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-30 (merge-queue AppHost repair)

Range reviewed: `fe9f443..3c910ea` (1 commit).

No new findings. Native correctness, Aspire project-metadata behavior, service-boundary policy, and package-only isolation were clean. Marking the two AppHost references as non-resource compiler references prevents the fleet source provider from generating shadow `Projects.*_AppHost` markers, so startup resolves the markers from the executable AppHost assemblies instead.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-30 (AppHost dependency containment)

Range reviewed: `d91df05..b4e358c` (1 commit).

No new findings. Native correctness, NuGet transitivity, Aspire marker resolution, service-boundary policy, and package-only isolation were clean. `PrivateAssets="all"` contains both AppHost dependency closures inside the source provider while retaining ordinary compile/runtime references; artifact inspection confirmed the executable AppHost assemblies and runtime files still reach the E2E output.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-30 (final main sync)

Merge reviewed: `21b290e` relative to both parents.

No new findings. Native merge-resolution review confirmed the merged solution preserves both the Auth migration tool from `main` and the fleet/TestKit projects from this branch. The regenerated inventory is current with 233 projects, six approved source-mode E2E edges, no blocking E2E edges, and no forbidden runtime-tooling edges; the full synced solution builds with zero errors.

## Security review — 2026-08-30 (final main sync)

Merge reviewed: `21b290e` relative to both parents.

No high- or medium-confidence findings. E2E admin routes remain non-packable, E2E-environment-only, fail-closed, fixed-time key protected, and absent from production hosts. The merged Auth/AppHost composition does not bypass those boundaries, and the source provider remains non-packable with private executable AppHost references.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-30 (hosting-abstraction sync)

Merge reviewed: `abed0218d97668521c51e9cb5689e653a25ad586` relative to both parents.

No new findings. Native review confirmed the sole conflict resolution preserves `main`'s serialized reset gate while retaining the TestKit reset and seed-state refresh. The server-side reset reseeds before returning, the widened hosting resource abstractions remain compatible with fleet composition, package pins resolve consistently to `0.1.0-alpha.0.1271`, and both parent-relative diffs are clean.

## Security review — 2026-08-30 (hosting-abstraction sync)

Merge reviewed: `abed0218d97668521c51e9cb5689e653a25ad586` relative to both parents.

No high- or medium-confidence findings. E2E admin routes remain E2E-environment-only, fail-closed, fixed-time key protected, non-packable, and absent from production project references. The hosting abstraction changes preserve resource references and waits; source/package mode remains intact, including private non-resource AppHost references.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-30 (AppHost runtime extensions)

Range reviewed: `12f331daa..85b9499bb` (1 commit).

No new findings. Native review confirmed the explicit `Aspire.Hosting.NodeJs` and `Aspire.Hosting.DevTunnels` references match the versions owned by `Concertable.Frontend.Hosting`, remain confined to the non-packable source provider, flow into both B2B and Customer E2E runtime outputs, and preserve `PrivateAssets="all"` isolation on the executable AppHost references.

## Security review — 2026-08-30 (AppHost runtime extensions)

Range reviewed: `12f331daa..85b9499bb` (1 commit).

No high- or medium-confidence findings. The centrally pinned packages use the existing hosting-project versions and recorded NuGet integrity hashes, add no production execution path, and do not weaken the AppHost dependency-containment or E2E trust boundaries.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-30 (platform .1273 sync)

Merge reviewed: `f7da6dfcb0ad645a5ed9db2f7ec3df913ed78174` relative to both parents.

No new findings. Native review confirmed the first-parent delta is exactly the seven coordinated platform-version bumps from `.1271` to `.1273`, matching `main`; the private AppHost references and explicit Aspire runtime extensions are preserved unchanged, with no conflict artifacts or package-boundary regression.

## Security review — 2026-08-30 (platform .1273 sync)

Merge reviewed: `f7da6dfcb0ad645a5ed9db2f7ec3df913ed78174` relative to both parents.

No high- or medium-confidence findings. The sync changes only centrally managed platform versions and introduces no source, provenance, package-ID, secret, listener, or trust-boundary change. The runtime-extension pins still match their owning hosting project and remain limited to the non-packable source provider.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-31 (merge-queue B2B reset repair)

Range reviewed: `380d6cda221d3d3f292923df58ea64e691bece25..c8f95947ba5a7f09101322ed555285b59c64871b` (1 commit).

No new findings. Native review confirmed the reset's temporary host context is scoped and restored in `finally`, the existing fixture gate serializes reset plus seed-state refresh, the fresh scoped seed catalog resolves generated application identities from persisted rows, and booking-to-concert mapping no longer depends on EF navigation fixup. The B2B E2E admin integration suite passed 7/7, Docker health passed, and the targeted door-split B2B API E2E passed against the full Aspire fleet.

## Security review — 2026-08-31 (merge-queue B2B reset repair)

Range reviewed: `380d6cda221d3d3f292923df58ea64e691bece25..c8f95947ba5a7f09101322ed555285b59c64871b` (1 commit).

No high- or medium-confidence findings. The host-mode tenant bypass remains confined to the authenticated reset handler in the E2E-only executable, `HttpContext` is restored in `finally`, the admin key remains required and fixed-time compared, the identity lookups are parameterized, and no production project references the E2E admin server. Separate `IHttpContextAccessor` async-local holders prevent a cross-request privilege leak.
