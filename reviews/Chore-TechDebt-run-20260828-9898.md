## Findings

No issues found. `AsbTopology` gains `WithService(serviceName)` plus scoped, parameterless
`Subscribe<TEvent>()`/`Queue<TCommand>()` overloads, both funneling through shared
`SubscribeCore`/`QueueCore` helpers alongside the retained (unchanged) string-taking overloads — no
duplication, no behavior change to existing call sites. `RequireServiceName()` throws before any
topic/queue side effect runs, so the guard is exception-safe. The five service topologies
(`AddAuthTopology`, `AddB2BTopology`, `AddCustomerTopology`, `AddPaymentTopology`, `AddSearchTopology`)
are deliberately left on the old overloads, since they consume `Concertable.AppHost.Shared` as a
version-pinned published package and migrating them now would build against an unpublished API —
tracked as the remaining step in `api/Concertable.AppHost.Shared/TECH_DEBT.md`. Three new unit tests
cover naming, mid-chain isolation between two `WithService` scopes, and the guard-throws case; all 10
tests in `Concertable.AppHost.Shared.UnitTests` pass, and `Concertable.AppHost.Shared` builds with zero
errors. No security-sensitive path is touched. Independent native review (code-reviewer) confirms no
correctness, duplication, or efficiency issues.

## Incremental review — 2026-08-28 (current-main sync)

> Range reviewed: `ea537c1a0757d2b70265f88e6f52b487d53aabcf..ee3b1505a520c5089a60cfa3fcca09bdeec61363` (merge of `origin/main`).

No issues found. The merge brought in 23 unrelated commits from `origin/main` (the
`TenantContactResolverStrategy` refactor and a platform-sync version bump) with no conflicts and no
change to any of the three files this review covers. `Concertable.AppHost.Shared` builds with zero
errors and `Concertable.AppHost.Shared.UnitTests` passes 10/10 after the merge.
