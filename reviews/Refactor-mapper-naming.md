### Scope

Mechanical rename/reorganization, no intended behavior change:

- Nine static `XResponseMappers` extension classes (Api layer, pure Dto->Response mapping) renamed to
  `XMappers`, converted from legacy `this`-parameter extension methods to C# 14 `extension()` blocks.
- `SelfBillingAgreementResponseMapper` renamed to `SelfBillingAgreementMappers`, same conversion.
- `ApplicationResponseMapper`/`IApplicationResponseMapper` and `OpportunityResponseMapper`/
  `IOpportunityResponseMapper` (Api layer, DI-injected, depend on `IConcertWorkflowCapabilityRegistry`)
  renamed to `ApplicationMapper`/`IApplicationMapper` and `OpportunityMapper`/`IOpportunityMapper`.
- The rename in the prior bullet collided (`CS0104`) with the Application layer's own
  `IApplicationMapper`/`IOpportunityMapper` (Entity->Dto), globally `using`'d project-wide in the Api host.
  Resolved by moving those two interfaces out of the flat `Application/Interfaces/` folder into
  `Application/Mappers/`, alongside their existing implementations — matching the pre-existing
  `IPaymentAmountMapper`/`IUserMapper` precedent. Applied the same move to `IDealMapper`
  (`Concertable.B2B.Deal.Application`) and `ITransactionMapper` (`Concertable.Payment.Application`) for
  consistency.
- Consumer updates: `ApplicationController.cs`, `OpportunityController.cs`, Concert Api
  `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`, `DealService.cs`, the five Deal keyed-strategy mapper implementations,
  `ApplicationServiceEligibilityTests.cs`, `TransactionServiceTests.cs`.

### Verification

- `Concertable.B2B.Web`, `Concertable.Customer.Web`, `Concertable.Payment.Web` build with 0 errors against
  this exact diff.
- `Concertable.B2B.Concert.UnitTests`, `Concertable.B2B.Deal.UnitTests`, `Concertable.Payment.UnitTests`
  build with 0 errors.
- Independent review lens (`workflow-review-lens`) read every file in the diff plus the repo-wide reference
  surface and checked for: leftover `*ResponseMapper(s)` references, `extension()` conversion correctness
  (receiver types, nullability, visibility), mixed legacy/`extension()` style within one class, unused or
  missing `using`s from the interface moves, completeness of the `Interfaces/` -> `Mappers/` moves, and
  naming-convention consistency. No defects found.

### Security pass

Dispatched a focused security review over the full diff, with special attention on the two flagged
security-sensitive paths (`ApplicationController.cs`, `OpportunityController.cs`). Confirmed no route,
authorization attribute (`[HasPermission]`, `[RequiredTenantType]`), method signature, or business-logic
change beyond the mapper type rename — every mapping expression, conditional, and gated action link is
byte-identical to before. No vulnerabilities found.

### Findings

No findings. Pass approved.
