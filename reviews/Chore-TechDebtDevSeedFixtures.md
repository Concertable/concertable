## Findings

Layer-1 native review (correctness, reuse, simplification, efficiency, error handling) over
`7629c9ae0..33ed717bb` at medium effort: no findings.

- [x] **CV1 — LOW — test coverage** — `app/shared/src/features/venues/api/venueApi.ts`,
  `app/shared/src/features/artists/api/artistApi.ts`,
  `app/web/b2b/shared/src/features/organizations/api/organizationApi.ts`
  `getMyVenue`/`getMyArtist`/`organizationApi.get` had zero test coverage before this branch — the
  `frontend-testing` skill lists "API modules … with the HTTP client mocked at its module boundary" as
  earning a unit test, and this diff changes exactly the branch (absent-value handling) that was the live
  bug. Fixed: added `getMyVenue`/`getMyArtist` null-vs-present cases to the existing `venueApi.test.ts` /
  `artistApi.test.ts`, and a new `organizationApi.test.ts` covering the 204→null and 200→data branches.

Security layer (touches `Concertable.Auth`): no findings. The Auth dev-seeder addition follows the
existing default-password pattern already used for every other seeded credential; the fixture change is
a hardening (reads back the real persisted user instead of a caller-supplied email).

No Lens B/C/D findings — no service-boundary, module-boundary or seeding-standard issues; the Auth
credential addition follows the existing direct-write seeding pattern and the B2B fixture change follows
the "get an authenticated client from the fixture" convention. No Lens E findings beyond CV1 — the diff
matches `csharp-style`/`csharp-naming`/`typescript-style`/`contract-naming`/`http-layer`/
`tiered-shared-code`/`docs-and-debt` as invoked.
