Native/general review layer plus a packaging-correctness lens over the frozen diff (repo-split stage 2,
round-trip 1: opt `Concertable.AppHost.Shared` into publishing). No repository skill is routed for the
changed paths; the governing standard is `packages` (BUILD1 + MinVer + PrivateAssets), applied by the
parent. No security-sensitive path is touched, so no security layer applies.

### Findings

- [x] **NAT1 — HIGH — packaging-correctness** — `api/Concertable.AppHost.Shared/Directory.Packages.props`
  The folder's own nearest-wins `Directory.Packages.props` had no `MinVer` `GlobalPackageReference`, so
  once packable the package would version at the SDK default `1.0.0` instead of the platform
  `0.1.0-alpha.N`, and never match the platform-sync pins round-trip 2 consumes. **Fixed** in `06dca73d5`:
  added `<GlobalPackageReference Include="MinVer" Version="7.0.0" />`, mirroring
  `api/Concertable.Messaging/Directory.Packages.props`. Verified: `dotnet pack` now emits
  `0.1.0-alpha.0.1204`, not `1.0.0`.
- [x] **NAT2 — MEDIUM — packaging-correctness** — `api/Concertable.AppHost.Shared/Directory.Build.props`
  The now-published folder omitted the package metadata every published sibling sets, and its comment
  still claimed "this folder doesn't yet [publish]". **Fixed** in `06dca73d5`: added `Authors`, `Company`,
  `RepositoryUrl`, `PackageProjectUrl`, `RepositoryType`, `PackageRequireLicenseAcceptance`,
  `MinVerTagPrefix`, `MinVerMinimumMajorMinor`, and corrected the comment, mirroring
  `api/Concertable.Messaging/Directory.Build.props`.

BUILD1 verified independently by the parent: AppHost.Shared's only `ProjectReference`
(`Concertable.Messaging.AzureServiceBus`) is already packable/published, and the project exposes no
Reunion carrier, so no `PrivateAssets="all"` is owed. Ledger doc changes carry no reviewable defect.

## Review pass — 2026-08-26 — incremental

**Candidate base:** `06dca73d57d50f2cf1c128fcf978f928734da7f6`
**Candidate head:** `6ada5c17c724aa62da7a175e00f5389ca55c4a1c`
**Candidate branch:** `Plan/RepoSplit-Stage2-AppHostShared`
**Candidate scope:** `eng/repository-split/inventory.json`
**Work-order path:** `reviews/Plan-RepoSplit-Stage2-AppHostShared.md`
**Work-order mode:** `append`
**Pass judgment:** `approved`

The `split-inventory` CI gate correctly flagged the committed `inventory.json` snapshot as stale after
AppHost.Shared became packable. Regenerated it with `python eng/repository-split/inventory.py` — a
deterministic tool, not a hand edit. The whole diff is `Concertable.AppHost.Shared` flipping
`packable: false → true` and joining `packableProjects`; `inventory.py --check` passes with
`blockingTestEdges` still 0 and no `apphost` edge collapse yet (that awaits the `*.Hosting` round-trips).

### Findings

No findings — mechanical regeneration matching the source-of-truth generator.
