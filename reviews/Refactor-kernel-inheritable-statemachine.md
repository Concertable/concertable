### Scope

Two files, 12 lines: `Concertable.Kernel.StateMachine<TState,TTrigger>` un-sealed with a `protected`
constructor, plus a new sealed `ConfiguredStateMachine<TState,TTrigger>` for direct edge-list
construction; `StateMachineTests` updated to construct the new concrete type.

### Rules manifest

Routed by `.agents/hooks/skill_router.py` for the exact changed paths: `dotnet-standards:microservice-boundaries`,
`dotnet:microservice-boundaries`, `dotnet-standards:unit-testing`, `dotnet:unit-testing`. Also applicable as
the naming/style floor: `dotnet-standards:csharp-style`, `dotnet-standards:csharp-naming`.

- microservice-boundaries — shared code (Kernel) must stay the intersection of what every service needs;
  this change adds a generic capability (inheritability), no audience-specific member. Compliant.
- unit-testing — xUnit shape, constructor-built SUT, real collaborators retained unchanged; only the
  constructed type name changed. Compliant.
- csharp-style — `ConfiguredStateMachine`'s primary constructor forwards only to `base(...)` and captures
  nothing, matching the "pure base-forwarding leaf type" exception to explicit fields. Compliant.
- csharp-naming — no suffix-table violation; not a DI-injected collaborator.

No path in this candidate matches the merge gate's `security_paths` inventory — no security layer required,
no security marker.

### Findings

None. Contract and behavior verified unchanged (same `Transition` signature, duplicate-edge
`ArgumentException`, immutable snapshot, concurrent-read safety) — proven by `Concertable.Kernel.UnitTests`,
246/246 passing against the new type.

**Work-order path:** `reviews/Refactor-kernel-inheritable-statemachine.md`
**Work-order mode:** `append`
**Pass judgment:** `approved`

### Scope

CI's monorepo `build` job compiles `Concertable.B2B` against `Concertable.Kernel`'s live project source
(not the published package), so the prior pass's `protected` constructor broke
`TenantVerificationEntity.cs`'s existing direct construction (`error CS0122`) immediately — not deferred to
a future package-sync PR as assumed. This pass reverts the constructor back to `public`, restoring exact
backward compatibility. `ConfiguredStateMachine` is retained: it's what gives `MA0053` a real derived type
in-assembly, independent of the constructor's own accessibility.

### Findings

None. Verified: `Concertable.Kernel.UnitTests` 246/246 passing; `Concertable.B2B.Tenant.Domain` builds clean
against the published Kernel package, unmodified, with this change.
