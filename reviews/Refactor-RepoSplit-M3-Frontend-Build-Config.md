**Pass judgment:** `approved`

### Findings

No findings. The extracted build-config package preserves independent CommonJS, ESM, TypeScript, and
package-export consumption, both mobile applications use the shared Metro package-resolution contract,
and the product workspaces retain their web/mobile package tiers under the authoritative
`platform-frontend` boundary. The full package, web, mobile, isolation, boundary, and plan-graph gates
passed. Security review found no new trust-boundary or dependency-resolution risk in the frozen delta.

### Findings

No findings. The plan-only checkpoint records draft PR #948, its direct #633 branch base, the retained-service,
`platform-dotnet`, `platform-frontend`, and separate `system` topology, and the delivery-time landed-main
restack gate. Security review found no risk in the publication metadata. PR #633 advanced after the reviewed
commit from the locally restacked `ad4ad986f` snapshot to `5e2dcf604`; the follow-up ledger correction records
that moving-base fact without changing the reviewed implementation delta.

## Review pass — 2026-09-07 — full landed-main restack

**Work-order path:** `reviews/Refactor-RepoSplit-M3-Frontend-Build-Config.md`
**Work-order mode:** `append`
**Pass judgment:** `approved`

### Findings

No findings. The seven-commit range-diff from the #633 snapshot to landed main is patch-equivalent throughout,
and the landed #633 changes do not overlap the M3 path set. The shared build configuration remains
product-neutral, product workspace ownership remains explicit, and both mobile applications consume the same
generic package-resolution helper. Boundary tests/lint, all package tests/builds, all five web builds, both
mobile typechecks and Android/Hermes exports, both feed-restored mobile carves, and an independent packed
consumer passed. Security review found no credential, trust-boundary, or unsafe dependency-resolution change.

## Review pass — 2026-09-07 — incremental split-inventory repair

**Work-order path:** `reviews/Refactor-RepoSplit-M3-Frontend-Build-Config.md`
**Work-order mode:** `append`
**Pass judgment:** `approved`

### Findings

No findings. The inventory generator and extraction map now use the approved `platform-frontend` identity
consistently and assign `app/build-config` to that target, with the package renamed to
`packages/build-config/` during extraction. The regenerated inventory is current, all frontend workspaces
are assigned, and the focused inventory check and plan-graph gate pass. Security review found no credential,
trust-boundary, or dependency-resolution risk in the repair.
