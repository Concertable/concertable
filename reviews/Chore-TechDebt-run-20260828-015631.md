### Findings

No findings. The change adds `^\.agents/` and `^\.codex/` to the `changes` job's `INERT` allowlist in
`.github/workflows/test.yml`, mirroring the exact in-scope list `docs-review`/`merge-docs` already use, and
deletes the now-resolved entry from the root `TECH_DEBT.md` (`docs-and-debt` skill applied — no other file
references the deleted entry). Verified locally: the updated regex evaluates `run_code=false` against the
PR #579 repro file set (markdown + `AGENTS.md` + `.agents/hooks/docs_reachability.py`), and still evaluates
`run_code=true` against a mixed docs+code diff, so no regression to the existing gate behaviour.

**Security pass:** `.github/workflows/test.yml` matches the hook's generic CI-workflow pattern, so a
focused security pass ran. No vulnerability found: `hook-tests` and `workflow-tests` carry no `run_code`
gate and run unconditionally on every push/PR/merge_group, so a tampered `.agents/`/`.codex/` file (hooks,
wiring) still fails `hook-tests`' byte-for-byte vendored-hook verification regardless of this diff's
classification; nothing under `.agents/`/`.codex/` is consumed by any `run_code`-gated job; and the
pre-existing guard forcing full CI whenever `test.yml` itself changes is untouched by this diff.
