r"""PreToolUse hook: no `gh pr merge` without a current, clean code-review.

Blocks a Bash tool call that would merge / enable auto-merge on a PR unless a
review work-order exists for the current branch, is stamped at the exact commit
being merged, and has zero open `- [ ]` findings. This is the *enforced* form of
the AGENTS.md rule "do a code-review before you merge" — advisory prose was
ignored once; a hook cannot be.

Scope: only fires on commands containing `gh pr merge`. `--disable-auto` (turning
a merge OFF) is always allowed — it is the safe direction. Every other merge form
(`--auto`, `--admin`, `--merge`, `--squash`, `--rebase`, bare) must pass the gate.

Contract: exit 0 = allow; exit 2 = block (stderr is fed back to the agent). For a
merge command the hook fails CLOSED — any doubt (missing/stale/unclean review, or
even an internal error) blocks, because letting an unreviewed merge through is the
exact failure this guard exists to prevent. Non-merge commands always exit 0.

The review file is what `code-review` / `docs-review` write:
`reviews/<branch-with-slashes-as-dashes>.md`, carrying a top-of-file
`**Reviewed up to commit:** \`<sha>\`` marker and `- [ ]` / `- [x]` findings.
