# Plan-progress checkpoint

Apply this procedure before a repository workflow reports its result.

## Resolve the plan

1. Prefer an explicit `plans/*.md` input supplied to the workflow.
2. Otherwise inspect the current worktree's absolute root, branch, upstream, status, commits, review
   artifacts, and PR. Correlate those facts with candidate plans and `_PROGRESS.md` metadata under
   `plans/`. Plan candidates are `*_PLAN.md`; exclude `AGENTS.md`, `*_PROGRESS.md`, `*_ROADMAP.md`, and
   bare-stem reference docs.
3. Continue only when the evidence identifies exactly one plan. If no plan or multiple plans remain,
   do not create, choose, update, or emit a handoff for one; finish the workflow normally.
4. Use the same-directory `<NAME>_PROGRESS.md` (the plan's `<NAME>_PLAN.md` stem). If it is a legacy plan without a ledger, create
   the ledger from `../assets/progress-template.md` with an explicitly labelled reconstructed baseline
   containing only facts supported by repository evidence.

## Record the transition

Read the plan and ledger, then reconcile them with the workflow's actual evidence. Update every
current-summary section affected by the event:

- worktree, branch, PR, and dependency or package gates;
- current state and partial or uncommitted work that must be preserved;
- `## Next Steps` — the single resolved next action as self-contained steps, including the prerequisite that blocks it when applicable;
- completed work with commit or PR evidence;
- verification commands and outcomes, tied to the code state they verified;
- decisions, discoveries, blockers, and deviations.

Append a dated event-log entry with the action, evidence, outcome, and follow-up. For review work,
also record the review type and range, artifact, every finding ID and disposition (`open`, `fixed`,
`deferred`, or `superseded`), and the fixing commit or deferral evidence. Never claim a transition
that the workflow did not verify.

Use workflow-specific evidence: implementation paths and partial state; review range, artifact,
watermark and finding dispositions; verification command, tested commit/working tree, counts and
result; commit subject and SHA (or `this commit` inside the commit that carries the entry); pushed
remote/range and resulting PR head; PR number/URL/head/checks; queue result and merge SHA; published
package/version/run; and platform-sync PR/version/check/merge state. Record failed, blocked, cancelled,
and no-op outcomes too, with the prerequisite or reason.

## Preserve and checkpoint

Keep the plan and ledger while any required review/fix, verification, PR/check/merge, publication,
dependency, or platform-sync gate is non-terminal. After the final gate, record its outcome and make
that ledger state durable before deleting the plan and ledger together in the following close-out
change. A final local phase with no later gate may close them in its completing commit.

Include the ledger update in the work commit when its evidence is already known. If the event became
known only after that commit or occurred remotely, stage only the plan/ledger changes and create an
immediate local checkpoint commit when repository rules permit. Never push merely because this
procedure created a checkpoint; pushing remains governed by the invoking workflow and user request.

### Push protocol

A plan-managed push has two legs. Resolve the plan and record the starting remote head, actual work
head, local range, branch, and PR when one exists. First push the actual work head without creating a
new push checkpoint. Fetch the branch and require its remote-tracking ref and any PR `headRefOid` to
equal that recorded work head. A successful command without those comparisons is not verified.

Only after the work head is verified, update the ledger with the evidenced pushed range, resulting
work and PR heads, outcome, and exact post-push next action. Stage only the plan and ledger and create
one checkpoint commit. Push that commit as a checkpoint-transport leg, then fetch and require local
`HEAD`, the remote-tracking ref, and any PR `headRefOid` to equal the checkpoint commit. Transport is
part of the same push event: it never invokes this procedure recursively, appends another push event,
or creates another checkpoint commit. The ledger records the verified work push and resulting next
action; it does not fabricate advance evidence that its own transport succeeded.

If the work-head leg fails or cannot be verified after diagnosis, record the failed, rejected, or
unknown outcome and exact known heads in one local failure checkpoint; do not push merely to publish
that failure record. If the work head was verified but checkpoint transport fails, keep the checkpoint
local. Amend that same commit with accurate transport failure, divergence, and prerequisite evidence
only when refreshed remote and PR refs prove it did not land. If its remote status is unknown, do not
rewrite a commit that may have landed: preserve its truthful work-head result, leave the corrective
ledger update in the working tree, and report every known or unknown head. Never claim final success
unless final local, remote-tracking, and PR equality is verified.

### Remote-transition protocol

Long-running delivery workflows checkpoint a material remote transition immediately after observing
it, before the next wait, mutation, checkout, or early stop. Resolve the plan once at workflow start
and retain its absolute worktree, source branch, PR number, and source PR `headRefOid` as the delivery
identity. Reconcile those values at every checkpoint.

When the transition does not require changing the source PR head, update the plan and ledger, stage
only those files, and create a local recovery commit. This is an observation checkpoint:

- never push it merely to publish the observation;
- never amend, push, or otherwise mutate a source PR that is queued, locked, merged, or closed;
- keep operating on the PR by number and verified remote `headRefOid`, not by assuming local `HEAD`
  is still the delivery head; and
- until the source PR merges, stack later observation checkpoints on its local branch.

A terminal green PR-check checkpoint made immediately before queue admission is intentionally local
only. Verify every commit after the PR's `headRefOid` changes only the active plan and ledger, verify
the PR head still equals the checked OID, then enqueue that exact PR head. On resume, this documented
checkpoint-only tail is not unpushed implementation work and must not be pushed, reset, or used to
block queue monitoring. If any commit in the tail changes another path, stop and record the
contradictory local state.

As soon as the source PR is `MERGED`, record its merge checkpoint, then move recovery ownership before
any publication or platform-sync wait:

1. Fetch `origin/main` and create `Docs/<epic>_<name>_closeout` in a clean sibling worktree.
2. Verify every commit after the recorded source `headRefOid` changes only the active plan and ledger,
   then cherry-pick those commits in order onto the close-out branch. Apply no runtime/source change.
3. Update the ledger's worktree and branch identity to the close-out worktree, and verify its plan and
   ledger content match the source worktree's latest committed state.
4. Remove the merged feature worktree and its local/remote branch immediately. Continue publication,
   dependency, and platform-sync checkpoints only in the close-out worktree.

If any post-source-head commit or dirty path is not the active plan/ledger, stop: the transfer is not
safe and the contradictory work must be resolved before teardown. The transfer itself is local-only;
do not push the close-out branch until its terminal net meta-only change passes `/docs-review` and is
landed through `/merge-docs`.

If the queue ejects the PR and a code fix is required, checkpoint the failure first. Once the PR is
confirmed open and unlocked, commit the fix after the local checkpoint tail and use the compound push
protocol above to publish the complete new head. A platform-sync fix belongs to the sync PR's own
branch or worktree: checkpoint its discovery and state in the active plan worktree (the close-out
worktree after source merge), but never push plan checkpoints to the sync PR or use them to mutate the
merged source PR.

The final report still requires a full reconciliation checkpoint. That hook verifies and records the
end state; it does not replace any transition checkpoint that should already exist.

## Report and hand off

Report the workflow result only after the checkpoint is durable, having written the immediate next
action into the ledger's `## Next Steps` section so it is the durable source of truth. If plan-managed
work remains, end with exactly one prompt, and it is ONLY the pointer — nothing plan-specific. Literally:

```
cd <absolute-worktree-path>
Read @plans/<PLAN>_PLAN.md and @plans/<PLAN>_PROGRESS.md and do what its `## Next Steps` says.
```

No branch to verify, checkpoints, gates, commands, or steps in the prompt — every such specific lives in
the ledger, never restated, so the prompt can't drift. If the lifecycle is terminal, follow the close-out
rule and do not invent a continuation prompt.
