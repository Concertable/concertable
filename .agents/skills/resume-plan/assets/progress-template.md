# <Plan title> progress

- Plan: `<repo-relative plan path, plans/<epic>/<NAME>_PLAN.md>`
- Worktree: `<absolute worktree path>`
- Branch: `<Type/<epic>_<name>, matching the <NAME>_PROGRESS stem>`
- PR: `<number and URL, or not opened>`
- Dependency/package gates: `<state, or none>`
- Last reconciled: `<date/time and evidence source>`

## Current state

<What exists now, including partial or uncommitted work that must be preserved.>

## Next Steps

<The single resolved action for the next agent, expressed as concrete, self-contained steps with any
prerequisite or blocking gate. Apply the repository's standing instructions and current evidence before
writing it, so it directs execution instead of presenting alternatives. This is the single source of
truth for what to do next — resume/handoff prompts point here instead of restating it, so they can never
drift. Keep it current at every checkpoint.>

## Completed work

<Completed phases and changes with commit/PR evidence.>

## Verification

<Commands/checks, outcomes, and the code state they verified.>

## Reviews

<Review type and range, artifact, findings, dispositions, and resulting commits.>

## Decisions, discoveries, blockers, and deviations

<Durable context that cannot be reconstructed safely from code alone.>

## Event log

### <YYYY-MM-DD — event>

- Action: <what happened>
- Evidence: <commit, command/result, artifact, PR/check, or package state>
- Outcome: <what changed>
- Follow-up: <remaining consequence or none>

## Resume prompt

<The single cd-first pointer to hand off after `/clear`. It ONLY points at this ledger's `## Next Steps`;
never restate the branch, gates, checkpoints, or steps here — they live in `## Next Steps` and must not be
duplicated where they can drift. Keep it verbatim in this fenced block:>

```
cd <absolute worktree path>
Read @plans/<PLAN>_PLAN.md and @plans/<PLAN>_PROGRESS.md, then do what the ledger's `## Next Steps` says.
```
