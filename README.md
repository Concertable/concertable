# How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop (running)
- A `GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN` environment variable set to a GitHub PAT with the `read:packages` scope.
  The AppHosts (root/B2B/Customer) build `Concertable.Auth`, which now restores its shared-platform
  dependencies as packages from the org's private GitHub Packages feed — without the token, restore
  fails (401 / NU1101) before the app starts. (Auth is the first service migrated to feed packages;
  the rest still build from source.)

### Start
From the repo root:
```
dotnet run --project api/Concertable.AppHost
```
Or alternatively, just click the play button on Visual Studio.
The Aspire dashboard will open and list all service URLs.

> **These are the only accounts that can pass financial transactions between each other** as they are the only ones with a **Stripe account** with **KYC (Know Your Customer)** associated with them.
>
> All other accounts have a **Stripe ID** but no associated Stripe account. Therefore, any attempted transactions made to these will result in the server informing you that a Stripe account needs to be created for the recipient in order for them to receive the funds.
