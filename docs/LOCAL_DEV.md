# Running the app locally

CI and the E2E suites set their own environment and secrets, so they never hit this. A **fresh checkout
or a fresh worktree cannot run any AppHost interactively** until you do a one-time setup, because two
pieces of config live outside git by design:

1. **SPA CORS / OIDC-redirect config** — `appsettings.Development.json` next to each service's
   `appsettings.json`. Gitignored (`**/appsettings.Development.json`). Without it every SPA login
   CORS-fails at `/.well-known/openid-configuration` (Auth) or `/api/auth/me` (the data service) — looks
   like a broken feature, is a missing file.
2. **ServiceAuth client secrets** — `dotnet user-secrets` on the AppHosts. Without them Auth crashes at
   startup: `InvalidOperationException: Configuration 'ServiceAuth:B2BClientSecret' is required.`

## One-time setup

```powershell
./scripts/setup-local-dev.ps1
# Or bootstrap only the owning service, from any working directory:
./api/Concertable.Customer/setup-local-dev.ps1 -WhatIf
./api/Concertable.Customer/setup-local-dev.ps1
```

Idempotent — creates only what's missing, never overwrites. It:

- copies `appsettings.Development.json.example` → `appsettings.Development.json` for `Concertable.Auth`,
  `Concertable.B2B.Web`, `Concertable.Customer.Web` (checked-in templates, no secrets — just
  `https://localhost:517x` origins);
- sets `ServiceAuth:{B2B,Customer,Auth}ClientSecret` user-secrets on `Concertable.AppHost`,
  and all five standalone service AppHosts to a shared dev value (not a secret — Auth
  and every service read the same value from the same AppHost config, and it never leaves localhost).

`user-secrets` storage is machine-wide, so step 2 is genuinely once-per-machine; the
`appsettings.Development.json` files are per-worktree (gitignored), so re-run the script (or copy the
files) in each new worktree.

Each service root owns its `setup-local-dev.ps1`. It only configures that service's source
settings and AppHost secrets; foreign service containers receive their configuration through the
owning AppHost. Auth, B2B, and Customer have source settings templates; Payment and Search require
only AppHost secrets. `-WhatIf` performs no SDK or user-secrets commands and writes no files.
The root router also accepts `-Owner Auth|B2B|Customer|Payment|Search`.

`-Owner FullStack` retains the existing source-based umbrella experience. A container-only System
host is a separate prerequisite: `./scripts/setup-local-dev.ps1 -Owner System -AppHostProject <path.csproj>`
requires an explicit Aspire AppHost with package references and no evaluated source ProjectReferences.
System mode requires the .NET SDK even with `-WhatIf`: it evaluates MSBuild items, including
`Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Build.targets`, and explicit imports, without building or restoring.
System bootstrap sets only that project's user-secrets and never changes service source settings.
The current `api/Concertable.AppHost` is rejected in System mode.

## Migration scaffolding

Each service owns `initial-migrations.ps1` and its `migrations.psd1` context manifest.
Messaging owns the platform Inbox/Outbox scaffolding. The root command delegates to those six owners:

```powershell
./api/initial-migrations.ps1 -WhatIf
./api/initial-migrations.ps1 -Owner Auth -Context PersistedGrantDbContext -WhatIf
./api/Concertable.Auth/initial-migrations.ps1
./api/Concertable.Auth/initial-migrations.ps1 -Check
```

Actual scaffolding and model checks require a compatible `dotnet-ef` tool, the .NET SDK, and
package-feed restore access. Dry runs require only PowerShell. Commands resolve projects relative to
the owner root and work after that root is extracted. Each command exports only its design-time
connection settings for the duration of the call and restores the caller's environment afterward.
Auth's two contexts both use `AuthDb`. Messaging's existing design-time factory still reads the
`ConnectionStrings__B2BDb` key, supplied with a parseable platform-only placeholder; it opens no database.

Scaffolding preserves the existing migration ID when normalized generated content is unchanged.
Backups live directly under the owner root, outside EF project compilation and on the checkout volume.
A failed scaffold restores that context's prior files; an earlier successfully scaffolded context
remains changed and is visible in Git. These commands do not apply migrations, start an AppHost,
or alter runtime migration behavior. Empty-database migration verification requires the owning
service's migration runner/integration checks against real SQL infrastructure.

The generic helper's canonical source is
`api/Concertable.Shared/tools/OwnerOperations.psm1`, destined for
`Concertable/platform-dotnet:tools/OwnerOperations.psm1`. Each owner carries a vendored copy.
Run `./scripts/sync-owner-tooling.ps1` to refresh copies and
`./scripts/sync-owner-tooling.ps1 -Check` to enforce byte parity.
`./scripts/test-owner-operations.ps1` checks isolated script closures, dry runs, bootstrap
idempotency, migration rollback/ID stability, environment restoration, and the System project gate
without invoking a real SDK, database, or user-secrets store.
`./scripts/test-system-bootstrap.ps1` additionally verifies imported-reference rejection through
real SDK evaluation; it performs no restore, build, or user-secrets writes.

## Stripe (optional)

Only needed for payment / settlement / webhook flows. `setup-local-dev.ps1` does **not** set it. If you
need it, use your own Stripe **test** key (same account as `pk_test_...` in `app/web/.env.development`):

```powershell
dotnet user-secrets set Stripe:SecretKey sk_test_xxx --project api/Concertable.B2B/src/Concertable.B2B.AppHost
```

Without it the `stripe-cli` resource is skipped and everything else runs.

## Running

```powershell
dotnet run --project api/Concertable.AppHost                       # the whole platform
dotnet run --project api/Concertable.B2B/src/Concertable.B2B.AppHost   # just the B2B slice (+ Auth, Payment)
```

The Aspire dashboard opens with links to every service and SPA. The SPAs are started by the AppHost.

### Port map

| Service | URL | SPA | URL |
|---|---|---|---|
| B2B API | `https://localhost:7086` | customer | `https://localhost:5174` |
| Search API | `https://localhost:7087` | venue | `https://localhost:5175` |
| Payment API | `https://localhost:7088` | artist | `https://localhost:5176` |
| Customer API | `https://localhost:7090` | business | `https://localhost:5177` |
| Auth | `https://localhost:7083` | admin | `https://localhost:5178` |

## Gotchas

- **Deeply-nested worktree + `LongPathsEnabled=0`** — a build can fail with
  `MSB3030: Could not copy the file "obj\Debug\net10.0\X.dll" because it was not found` on the
  longest-named projects (`Concertable.Shared.Notification.Infrastructure`,
  `Concertable.Customer.DataAccess.Infrastructure`) when the `obj` DLL path exceeds 260 chars. Enable long
  paths (`reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem /v LongPathsEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1`,
  admin, then reboot), or run from a shallower path (the main checkout, not a
  `.worktrees/Long-Branch-Name/` one).
- **Native DLL loading caps at 250 characters, and `LongPathsEnabled` does not lift it** — a host whose
  `runtimes/win-x64/native/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.dll` path exceeds 250 characters dies on its first SQL
  connection with `DllNotFoundException ... The filename or extension is too long. (0x800700CE)`, which
  surfaces as an Aspire resource that never reaches `Running`. The registry flag above governs managed path
  APIs; a `longPathAware` application manifest was measured against this failure and does not help either. The
  four E2E host executables therefore set `BaseOutputPath` to `artifacts/e2e/<host>/`, which takes the longest
  from 252 characters to 202. Budget for a new host: its output directory plus 57 characters must stay at or
  under 250.
- **SQL data volume** is isolated per worktree automatically (hashed on the AppHost working directory) —
  no manual naming needed since 2026-08-22.
- `appsettings.E2E.json` **is** committed (it holds only fixed-localhost E2E config, no secrets) — don't
  confuse it with `appsettings.Development.json`.

## Follow-up

`setup-local-dev.ps1` doesn't yet verify the OIDC dev-cert trust (`dotnet dev-certs https --trust`) or
check for a running Docker engine before an AppHost start. Add those if this keeps biting.
