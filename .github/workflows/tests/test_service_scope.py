"""Prove service scoping and queue E2E dependencies only ever narrow CI safely.

The classifier decides which services a diff can affect, so an unrelated service's
suites and standalone carve never gate a PR. Getting it wrong is silent: a suite
that should have run simply does not. The classifier block and dependency graph
are read from test.yml itself rather than restated here, so the test cannot drift
from the gate.
