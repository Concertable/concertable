## `azure-functions-core-tools` pinned to 4.12.1 in `workflows/test.yml`

`npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@4` resolves to the latest npm-published version
(4.13.2 at time of writing), but that version's binary zip 404s from Microsoft's CDN
(`cdn.functions.azure.com`) — confirmed broken for 4.13.0/4.13.1/4.13.2 alike, blocking the
entire merge queue (`e2e-api-tests` fails at the "Install Azure Functions Core Tools" step
before any test runs). Pinned to 4.12.1, the newest version confirmed to actually download.

Un-pin (back to floating `@4`, or bump the pin) once a newer published version is confirmed to
download successfully from the CDN.

## Unit and integration tests fan out to one runner job per test project

`workflows/test.yml` builds its matrices from a `find` over the test projects
(`unit_projects`, `integration_projects`), so each `*.UnitTests.csproj` and
`*.IntegrationTests.csproj` gets its own job. A heavy run is 36 unit jobs and 27
integration jobs, and every one of them repeats the same checkout, `setup-dotnet`,
NuGet restore and build-artifact download before running a single project.

Measured on run 34163047609: unit-tests 64 billed minutes against 44 minutes of real
work, integration-tests 77 against 64, whole run ~185 billed against ~140 real. The gap
is duplicated setup plus Actions rounding every job up to a whole minute 63 times.

This costs nothing today because Actions is free on public repositories. It becomes the
blocker on going private: ~73,500 billable minutes a month against the 3,000 a paid plan
includes, roughly £330/month at current volume.

Chunk both matrices — groups of projects per job rather than one project per job — and run
`dotnet test` over each group. Same projects, same coverage, roughly halves a heavy run.
Resolve when the matrices emit groups and a heavy run bills near its real duration.
