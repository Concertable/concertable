# Money value type — a Kernel `Money(decimal, Currency)`, publish-first

**Next steps live in @plans/launch/MONEY_VALUE_TYPE_PROGRESS.md → `## Next Steps`.**

> **Why:** money is raw `decimal` in the domain/service layer and hand-cast to `long` pence at **8+ sites**
> with an independent **truncating** `(long)(x*100)` at each — no owner for the conversion, the rounding
> rule, or the `gross/fee/total` arithmetic. Decision + rationale (hand-roll, not NodaMoney; carry
> `Currency` from day one; GBP ×100 for now) live in
> [`api/Concertable.Shared/TECH_DEBT.md`](../../api/Concertable.Shared/TECH_DEBT.md) → *"No money type"*.
> This plan is the execution. It **enables** [`b2b/PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md`](PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md):
> the platform fee's `gross + fee` is built on `Money`, not a fourth `(long)(x*100)` site.

## The type (Kernel, additive)

```csharp
public enum Currency { Gbp = 826 }   // ISO-4217 numeric; only GBP for now, shaped for the ISO table later

public readonly record struct Money(decimal Amount, Currency Currency)
{
    // GBP ×100 today; a per-currency exponent (JPY ×1, BHD ×1000) is a later concern — see TECH_DEBT.
    public long ToMinorUnits() => (long)Math.Round(Amount * 100m, 0, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero);
    public static Money FromMinorUnits(long minor, Currency ccy) => new(minor / 100m, ccy);
    public static Money Zero(Currency ccy) => new(0m, ccy);

    public static Money operator +(Money a, Money b) => Same(a, b) with { Amount = a.Amount + b.Amount };
    public static Money operator -(Money a, Money b) => Same(a, b) with { Amount = a.Amount - b.Amount };
    // same-currency guard THROWS on mismatch — never silently coerce (TECH_DEBT: don't default away a failure)
}
```

- **`decimal`-backed, never `double`.** Immutable, value-equal (record struct).
- **One rounding rule, owned here:** round to the minor unit *before* summing; `AwayFromZero`, matching
  Stripe. The naked truncating `(long)` casts are deleted, not moved.
- **Currency carried but not yet branched on:** GBP ×100 hardcoded; the *shape* (schema, wire, type) is
  future-proofed, the per-currency machinery is not built (revisit NodaMoney when multi-region is real).

## Boundaries this crosses (why it's multi-PR)

`Money` lives in the **published `Concertable.Kernel` package**; every service compiles against the package,
not the source (the carve). Adding the type is **additive** (safe, one publish). Changing a **published
signature** to use it — the `Concertable.Payment.Client` interfaces B2B consumes — is **breaking** and needs
its own publish-first cut-over. So the migration is sequenced by those boundaries, not by convenience.

**Inventory (from TECH_DEBT):** service-layer/client `decimal` signatures — `ISettlementAmountResolver`,
`deal.Fee`, the payment clients — plus the pounds↔pence sites: `Concertable.Payment.Infrastructure` ×6
(`EscrowService`, `ManagerPaymentService`, `StripePaymentIntentClient`, `StripeTransferClient`,
`StripeAccountClient`, `PaymentManager`; + the `FakeStripePaymentIntentClient` double),
`Concertable.Payment.Seed/E2EStripeAccountClient`, `Customer.Ticket.Infrastructure/TicketService`.

## Phases

Every phase: `dotnet build api/Concertable.slnx` (0 errors) + affected unit + integration via
`integration-debug`. Model-touching phases end with `./initial-migrations.ps1` from `api/`. Publish-gated
phases follow the merge → `publish-packages` → `chore/platform-sync-*` to green discipline (root `CLAUDE.md`).

### Phase 1 — `Money` + `Currency` in Kernel (additive; publish-gated) ✅ DONE

Added `Concertable.Kernel.ValueObjects.Money` (`readonly record struct`) + `Currency` enum with unit tests:
minor-unit rounding at the boundary (`£12.345 → 1235`), `FromMinorUnits` round-trip, `+`/`-` arithmetic,
**currency-mismatch throws `DomainException`**, `Zero`. Nothing consumes it yet — the pure additive expand.
Gate green: `dotnet build api/Concertable.slnx` 0 errors + Kernel unit tests pass.

**Gate:** build + `Concertable.Kernel` unit tests. `[skip-e2e]` (no behaviour). **Then:** merge → publish →
follow `chore/platform-sync-*` to green so the new pin is on every service before Phase 2.

### Phase 2 — Payment adopts `Money` internally + gRPC wire → nested `Money` message ✅ DONE (validated)

Routed all Payment money through `Money`, deleting the 6 (+fake) truncating casts (grep for
`(long)(…*100)` / `/100m` in `Payment/src` returns zero). The gRPC wire moved from
**decimal-as-invariant-string → a nested `Money` proto message (`int64 amount_minor` + `Currency` enum)**;
the server maps `request.Amount.ToMoney()` → `Money.FromMinorUnits(minor, currency)`. The published C#
client interfaces kept their `decimal` params (adapters wrap `Money.Gbp(amount).ToProtoMoney()`), so B2B
needs **no source change** — but the **wire itself is a breaking cross-service contract** (see the gate).
Internal service/request/Stripe-option signatures now carry `Money`.

> **The wire IS a cross-service package boundary — this was the trap.** B2B/Customer consume the gRPC
> client from the **published `Concertable.Payment.Client` package**, not source. So "client and server
> regenerate together" only holds *inside* the package; across the B2B→Payment boundary the packaged
> client lags the source server until the pin bumps. A hard wire swap therefore **cannot pass its own
> merge-queue E2E** (new source server vs old packaged B2B client → `currency Unspecified` → 500 on every
> escrow/settlement path) — it deadlocks: the E2E can't go green until the pin bumps, and the pin only
> bumps after merge. This is a **package cut-over**, handled below.

Decisions taken during implementation:
- **`EscrowEntity.Amount` is now a `Money` value object mapped as an EF `ComplexProperty`** → flat
  `Amount decimal(18,2)` + `Currency int` columns (matches the `ESignature` complex-type convention). This
  **supersedes** the plan's original "keep the `long` minor-unit column" (M4): a proper value object beats a
  leaked `AmountMinor`/`Currency`/computed-`Amount` triple, and re-scaffold is free (no data). `Transaction`
  entities stay `long amount` (no currency) — they carry no casts and are reconstructed from webhook metadata
  already in minor units; out of Phase 2's scope.
- **`Money.Gbp(decimal)` DDD factory** to kill the repeated `new Money(x, Currency.Gbp)` — a **Kernel
  (published-package) change**, so it shipped publish-first as its own PR (#205, merged; pin bumped to
  `0.1.0-alpha.0.662`). This branch rebased onto that pin and now uses `Money.Gbp(x)` at every call site
  (no whole-number `m` suffix needed — `int`→`decimal` is implicit). ✅ Done.
- `initial-migrations.ps1` was missing Payment's `asb`/`PaymentDb` connection strings (Payment.Web builds the
  full host at design time, unlike B2B/Customer) — added, so re-scaffold works standalone.
- **B2B integration skipped locally**: its fixture mocks `IEscrowClient`/`IManagerPaymentClient`
  (`ApiFixture.cs`), so it never touches the wire/server/`Money` — zero signal.
- **The wire nested `Money` message collides with the Kernel `Money` VO** in the server request-mapper
  files (both `Concertable.Payment.Grpc.Money` and `…Kernel.ValueObjects.Money` in scope) — resolved with a
  `using Money = …Kernel…Money;` alias, the same collision-resolution the codebase uses for Stripe
  `Transfer`/`Refund`.

**Gate (a package cut-over, not a normal merge):**
- build 0 errors ✅ + `Payment` unit (30) ✅ + re-scaffold ✅, on pin `0.1.0-alpha.0.662`.
- This PR ships **`[skip-e2e]`** — the merge-queue E2E *cannot* pass here (packaged B2B client still on the
  old wire; see the callout above). Skipping is correct, not a shortcut: E2E can only be meaningful once
  the pin bumps and the client realigns.
- **Sequence (done):** #207 merged (`[skip-e2e]`) → `Payment.Client` republished → sync PR #208 bumped
  every pin to `0.1.0-alpha.0.664` → B2B/Customer now speak the new wire. The sync PR's merge-queue
  skipped the real E2E (pin-bump-only classifier), so it was validated by a **local API-E2E run on
  `main`: B2B `Concertable.B2B.E2ETests` 10/10 green** (all ConcertDraft/Cancelled/Finished escrow +
  settlement paths — the ones that 500'd on `currency Unspecified` pre-bump). Cut-over proven end to end.

Because the wire is now cut over in Phase 2, **Phase 5 no longer touches the wire** — it's reduced to the
published C# `decimal → Money` signature swap (`ISettlementAmountResolver`, `IEscrowClient` params, etc.).

### Phase 3 — Platform fee, built on `Money` *(rides Phase 2; see PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md)*

Execute [`b2b/PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md`](PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md) on top of `Money`: `gross + fee` is
`Money.operator+`, the snapshot is `Money.ToMinorUnits()`, no new conversion site. This is where money
actually changes (the fee). Kept as its own plan/PR; **this plan's Phase 2 is its prerequisite** so the fee
never touches raw `decimal` arithmetic.

### Phase 4 — Customer adopts `Money` (`TicketService`, `E2EStripeAccountClient`)

Same internal treatment for the remaining pounds↔pence sites outside Payment. Independent of Phase 3.

**Gate:** build + `Customer` unit + integration + E2E (ticketing path). Re-scaffold if a model changes.

### Phase 5 — Contract: published signatures `decimal` → `Money` (breaking; publish-first)

The final half of expand/contract — remove the last raw-`decimal` money signatures:
- `ISettlementAmountResolver.ResolveGrossAsync` → `Money`, `deal.Fee` → `Money` (B2B-internal, same-PR).
- `Concertable.Payment.Client` interfaces `decimal` → `Money` (**breaking** — B2B migrates in the sync PR).

**Grep gate (definition of done):** `rg -nE "\(long\)\(.*\* 100|/ 100m?\b" api` returns **zero** outside
`Money` itself; no money-typed `decimal` parameter remains on a resolver/client signature. Publish → sync.

## Sequencing decision (the one call to make)

**Recommended: Money first (P1→P2), then the fee rides it (P3).** The whole point of the investigation was
that the fee's arithmetic + conversion belong in `Money`; building the fee on `decimal` first and migrating
later is double work and re-introduces the smear temporarily. The critical path to revenue is
**P1 → P2 → P3**; P4/P5 are non-blocking cleanup that can land whenever.

**Alternative (only if revenue urgency beats tidiness):** ship the fee on `decimal` now (it's 2 dp,
conversion-safe) and treat the whole of this plan as the follow-up that absorbs it — accepting that P2/P5
then rework the fee code. Not recommended, but noted.

## Branch/PR shape

`Money` is a Kernel concern, not the platform-fee feature — so **its own branch** (e.g.
`Refactor/MoneyValueType`), landed publish-first, *before* the `Feature/PlatformCommission` fee PR rebases
onto the new pin. This plan doc can ride the current branch (docs are branch-exempt); execution starts on a
fresh branch off `origin/main`.

## Risks

| # | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | Money migration merged before its platform-sync pin lands → consumers can't see `Money` | Publish gate is a hard stop between P1 and P2 (and before P3 rebases). Confirm the sync PR merged + pin bumped first. |
| M2 | Rounding change silently alters existing amounts | GBP is 2 dp; every current amount is already exact at ×100, so `AwayFromZero` rounding is a no-op on real data. Assert round-trip in P1 unit tests; E2E on P2/P4 covers the money paths. |
| M3 | gRPC wire change (string→int64) breaks a consumer | The wire is internal to Payment's client+server (both regenerate together); B2B's C# calls are unchanged because the adapter keeps `decimal` until P5. All services rebuild on the P2 sync. |
| M4 | EF value-conversion of `Money` mis-maps or breaks queries | Map to the existing `long` minor-unit column + a `Currency` column; keep the stored representation identical to today (only the C# type changes). Integration tests on read/write paths. |
