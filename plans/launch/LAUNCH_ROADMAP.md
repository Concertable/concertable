# Concertable Launch Roadmap

> **Roadmap** for the launch epic — the living progress tracker, not a plan (no `_PROGRESS.md`, never deleted, lives until launch). Each buildable item spins off its own feature plan; see [`../agents/ROADMAP.md`](../agents/ROADMAP.md).
>
> **Goal:** Production launch of the B2B platform (venue↔artist booking + automated settlement) by **November 2026**.
>
> **Companion docs:** [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md), [USER_MODEL_PLAN.md](../b2b/USER_MODEL_PLAN.md), [MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md](../marketplace/MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md), [../../api/Concertable.B2B/src/Modules/Deal/LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md](../../api/Concertable.B2B/src/Modules/Deal/LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Status — what's shipped vs. what's left

**Shipped — verified in code, don't rebuild:** Tenant model + membership + 6-role RBAC · payout re-keyed to `TenantId` · Stripe Connect Express with both money flows (escrow `OnBehalfOf` for FlatFee/VenueHire; `TransferData.Destination` for DoorSplit/Versus) · temporary Payment-owned £10 platform fee on all four settlement types · append-only balanced Payment ledger · artist↔venue messaging · settlement for all four contract types · the 3% PRS skim is correctly absent.

**Decisions locked (see §9 / decision log):**
- [x] Revenue model — **resolved for launch 2026-07-30: one Payment-owned percentage of the final B2B-calculated deal gross.** The payer pays gross plus commission and the payee receives gross. B2B owns four deal-gross strategies; Payment owns one deal-agnostic commission calculation. The shipped £10 fee is temporary and must be removed before launch. See [PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md](PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md) and the decision log.
- [x] DoorSplit/Versus revenue source — **resolved: manual door-takings entry + charge-the-venue** for v1 (external-ticketer import ruled out — §9). All four contract types ship in the pure-B2B MVP, no marketplace dependency. See §9 / R9.

**Build — MVP blockers, in priority order:**
- [x] ✅ **Concert cancellation + escrow refund** — cancel a *booked concert* (escrow `Held`): `Booked → Cancelled` + refund. Wires `EscrowEntity.Refund()` (the method existed; B2B never called it). Shipped in PR #76 (concert-cancel path across all four contract types, venue SPA cancel action, API + UI E2E). **This is the concert-cancel path only** — application-cancel below is still open.
- [x] ✅ **Application cancellation** — shipped (`Feature/ApplicationCancel`): artist **withdraw** + venue **reject** from `Applied`; venue **cancel** / artist withdraw from `Accepted`/`PaymentFailed` → terminal `Cancelled` with the escrow unwind via the existing `RefundByBookingIdAsync` (no new Payment capability), late-capture compensation for the 3DS-window race, opportunity re-opens on cancel (application- and concert-cancel alike), HATEOAS-gated actions in both manager SPAs (venue Deny/Cancel; artist My Applications page + Withdraw). Optional FlatFee hold-release RPC deliberately skipped — orphaned accept-checkout holds self-expire in ~7 days (logged in [api/TECH_DEBT.md](../../api/TECH_DEBT.md)).
- [x] ✅ **E-signed booking agreement** — shipped (`Feature/BookingAgreement`): click-wrap consent at Apply + Accept, agreed terms snapshotted at Accept (immutable `BookingAgreementEntity`, terms-fingerprint guard against mid-flight edits), PDF via `IPdfRenderer` (`BookingAgreementDocument`, generated background-at-Accept with a lazy render-on-download fallback, stored under the `agreements/` blob prefix), both-party-authorized `GET /api/Application/{id}/agreement` + `/agreement/pdf` endpoints, HATEOAS `agreement` link, download links in both manager SPAs. **Advanced-tier self-hosted e-signature** (typed full name required + optional drawn signature, rendered into the PDF Signatures block; no third party / no per-signature cost) — upgraded from the original Tier 1 click-wrap. LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS item 2.
- [x] ✅ **DoorSplit/Versus door-take entry at settlement** — shipped (`Feature/DoorRevenueSettlement`): the venue declares the **external** door take on an ended, still-`Booked` revenue-share concert (`POST /api/Concert/{id}/door-revenue`, venue-tenant guarded, HATEOAS-gated "Enter door takings" action in the venue SPA). Settlement charges the artist's % of **`TicketsSold × Price + DoorRevenue`** — Concertable's own ticket sales **plus** the declared external take, never either alone. The "awaiting declaration" rule is single-sourced via a composable `PredicateSpecification` combinator (published to Kernel, platform `.576`), shared by the completion sweep and a backend `AwaitingDoorRevenue` KPI. **All four contract types now settle.** See §1 / R9.
- [x] ✅ **DAC7 onboarding completion** — shipped (`Feature/Dac7Onboarding`): fail-closed DAC7 payout gate + jurisdiction seam (UK-only, keyed strategy) + tax-details nag on both dashboards; VAT collapsed to a single number. NINO / UTR / Company-Reg on `Tenant.Compliance`; no payout until the payee tenant is jurisdiction-complete (no de-minimis for services — reportable from £1).
- [x] ✅ **Self-billed VAT invoice engine** — complete (`Feature/VatAndSelfBilledInvoicing` + `Feature/SelfBillingAgreement`): invoice generation (per-settlement immutable invoice, gap-free per-supplier numbering, VAT-status branching (inclusive-gross decompose), HMRC self-billing legends + both parties' VAT numbers, PDF via `IPdfRenderer` lazy render-on-download `invoices/` prefix, two-party-scoped `GET /api/Concert/{id}/invoice[/pdf]` + HATEOAS link — items 1, 3, 4) **plus** the per-supplier self-billing *agreement* + 12-month renewal consent: immutable e-signed `SelfBillingAgreementEntity` (single-owner, frozen identity + supplier e-signature, `ExpiresAtUtc = AcceptedAtUtc + 12 months`, lazy PDF under `self-billing-agreements/`), append-only grant/renew surface in both manager SPAs (HATEOAS grant/renew/pdf + dashboard nag), and a **fail-closed settlement gate** — `FinishExecutor` mints no self-billed invoice unless the supplier holds a current agreement, deferring + self-healing on the hourly sweep exactly like the tax-compliance gate. The invoice's "raised under a self-billing agreement" legend is now always truthful.
- [x] ✅ **`holdsMusicLicence` attestation** on `Tenant.Compliance` — shipped (`Feature/launch_music-licence-attestation`): one `bool` on the shipped `TaxCompliance` VO, threaded through the org read/update DTO + mapper and the b2b/shared Org setup form (new "Music licence" checkbox). Record-only — the venue's responsibility; no verification, no payout/booking gate.
- [x] ✅ **Swim-lane B complete** — membership/invitation endpoints + auth sweep + messaging group-inbox (USER_MODEL_PLAN Phases 6-8, all shipped; plan deleted). **Phase 6** (`Feature/TenantInvitationsFrontend`): invitation endpoints + last-Owner invariants + provisioning invitation-first branch + member-management UI + tenant switcher + UI E2E. **Phase 8** (`Feature/MessagingGroupInbox` + `Feature/MessagingGroupInboxPhase2`): tenant-owned conversations, per-member read pointer, member SignalR + email fan-out, org-identity/member-attribution DTO + group-inbox SPA, new Conversations unit/integration + UI E2E. **Phase 7** (`Feature/RetireRoleClaim`): retired the flat `Role` enum, manager-profile tables, and the `role` token claim — B2B tokens are identity-only; `/me` collapsed to one membership-shaped DTO; guards/persona derive from tenant memberships.
- [x] ✅ **Per-contract-type VAT calculation** — shipped (`Feature/VatAndSelfBilledInvoicing`): inclusive-gross decomposition branching on supply direction + supplier VAT-registration status, in the Tenant tax area, consumed by Concert via `ITenantModule` (items 1, 3).
- [ ] 🟠 **Percentage commission + B2B pricing transparency** — Payment Phase 1 is implemented and verified: immutable percentage revisions, Payment-issued authorizations, authorization-aware money RPCs, and durable transaction/refund/tax/ledger facts. Merge, package publication, Payment runtime deployment and platform sync remain the hard gate before B2B adds the four gross strategies and payer disclosure in Phase 2; the temporary £10 seam is removed only in Phase 3. See [PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md](PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md).
- [ ] 🔴 **Production deployment + config/secrets** — the app has **no** deployment path, config store, or secret store (all local Aspire + emulators; secrets committed to source, incl. a plaintext Azure SQL password). Surfaced 2026-07-17. Hard launch gate. Plan: [../CONFIG_AND_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md](../platform/CONFIG_AND_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md).

**Verify before trusting — competitor table-stakes, not confirmed in code:** reviews/reputation end-to-end · calendar sync (Google/Apple/Outlook) · financial/settlement CSV export.

The legal/business track is [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md); the hard launch gates are in §7.

## 1. Vision and scope

**In scope for the v1 launch:**
- B2B SaaS marketplace for venue↔artist bookings
- Four contract types (FlatFee, DoorSplit, VenueHire, Versus)
- Automated settlement via Stripe Connect Express
- Disclosed-agent legal posture (Concertable acts as venue/artist's agent for money handling)
- Multi-staff Tenant model (Owner + Manager roles)
- DAC7-compliant seller onboarding
- Cancellation/refund handling on the B2B path (venue or artist cancels — escrow refunds correctly)
- Per-booking signed agreement (click-wrap e-signature, terms snapshotted at Accept) — see [LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md](../../api/Concertable.B2B/src/Modules/Deal/LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md) item 2
- Per-contract-type VAT calculation + VAT-compliant self-billed invoices per settlement (items 1, 3, 4)
- Per-tenant configuration surface (PRS, VAT, payment terms, cancellation defaults). The platform fee is Payment-owned platform configuration, not a tenant override.

**DoorSplit/Versus revenue source — resolved (2026-06-22):** these two settle against door/ticket revenue, which standalone B2B (no marketplace) has no automatic feed for. The confirmed v1 feed is **manual door-take entry + charge-the-venue**: the venue enters the door take at settlement, Concertable charges the venue for the artist's share (+ our fee) and pays the artist through Stripe Connect — identical to FlatFee escrow. So **all four contract types ship in the pure-B2B MVP** with no marketplace dependency. The own checkout (deferred) only *upgrades* DoorSplit/Versus later (verified number instead of self-reported, no venue credit risk). See §9.

**Out of scope for v1 (planned, not abandoned):**
- Customer-facing ticket marketplace — see [MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md](../marketplace/MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md). Designed to be additive; switch-on planned Q1 2027 or later once B2B has traction.
- Mobile app distribution to App Store / Play Store
- Native push notifications
- Multi-currency / international expansion
- More granular membership roles beyond Owner/Manager
- Org-switcher UI (one user managing multiple orgs)

**The differentiation thesis:** GigPig and GigXchange are flat-fee booking tools — GigPig even markets automated payments and a "Payment House" that splits one venue payment across artists (2026 site copy) — so *flat-fee* booking + auto-payout is table stakes, not a moat. Concertable's edge is **settling the revenue-share contract types (DoorSplit/Versus), which neither competitor does**: the door take is entered at settlement and the artist's share moves through our own Stripe Connect (charge the venue → pay the artist). Crucially this needs **no ticketing ownership** — manual door-take entry + charge-the-venue is enough — so the moat is the typed revenue-share *settlement*, not a ticketing platform. Unlike DICE (closed, ticketing-first), Concertable also owns the venue↔artist booking + contract workflow. **That is the whole MVP thesis: out-compete GigPig/GigXchange on the contract types they structurally can't settle** — which is why DoorSplit/Versus must be sellable at v1 (now resolved via manual entry, §9), not deferred.

## 2. Three parallel swim-lanes

Three workstreams run in parallel across the six months. Each has different owners and dependencies.

### Swim-lane A — Legal & Business
**Owner:** you (with solicitor + accountant)
**Detail:** [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md)

Company registration, ICO, T&Cs, insurance, accounting, HMRC platform-operator registration, Stripe production activation. Mostly admin work scattered across the six months; some elapsed-time dependencies (solicitor drafting takes 2-4 weeks).

### Swim-lane B — Architecture
**Owner:** you (or contractor dev)
**Detail:** [USER_MODEL_PLAN.md](../b2b/USER_MODEL_PLAN.md)

The tenancy refactor — the load-bearing structural change that everything else attaches to, sequenced as the phases in the timeline below. The tenant-scoping foundation (Tenant module with a Guid PK, request-scoped tenant filtering, the compliance value object) has shipped; the outstanding work — multi-user membership, roles, and the authorization sweep — is tracked in [USER_MODEL_PLAN.md](../b2b/USER_MODEL_PLAN.md).

### Swim-lane C — Compliance UI/UX + workflow polish
**Owner:** you (or contractor dev)
**Detail:** §5 of this plan

The smaller code items that don't fit in either of the other swim-lanes: cookie banner, pricing transparency, refund/cancellation codification, DAC7 export script, legal-page routes, OSA report-content flow, etc. Some items block on legal text (T&Cs) being drafted first; others can run earlier.

## 3. 6-month timeline

Calendar-realistic, not optimistic. Slips are flagged as risks (§6).

| Month | Swim-lane A (Legal/Business) | Swim-lane B (Architecture) | Swim-lane C (Compliance UI/UX) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Month 1 (Jun 2026)** | Company registered (Companies House, ~£12, 24hr) · ICO fee paid (~£40-60/yr) · Solicitor engaged + briefed for T&Cs · **Revenue model decided** · **DoorSplit/Versus revenue-source decision** (§9) | **Phase 0** — `Tenant` module scaffolding · **Phase 1** — `ComplianceContext` value object + tenant config surface | **Music licence attestation field** spec (= PRS self-licensed flag; wired in Phase 1) · _(PRS correction in `LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` ✅ done 2026-06-01)_ |
| **Month 2 (Jul 2026)** | Business bank account opened · Accountant engaged · Solicitor drafts circulating | **Phase 2** — Venue/Artist wired to Tenant | **Cookie banner** scaffolding on all 3 SPAs (text from solicitor still pending) |
| **Month 3 (Aug 2026)** | Insurance arranged (Professional Indemnity + Cyber) · Stripe production application submitted | **Phase 3** — `PayoutAccountEntity` re-key to TenantId | **Pricing transparency** at each payer commitment point (Payment quote package first) |
| **Month 4 (Sep 2026)** | Solicitor T&Cs finalised · DPA signed with Stripe · ICO documentation (privacy policy, lawful basis, retention) | **Phase 4** — `ComplianceContext` snapshot on Booking · **Phase 5** — Organization setup UI | **Privacy + T&Cs page routes** wired up (solicitor text now in hand) · **Venue legal details on emails** template change · **Booking agreement + click-wrap e-sign** at Accept (PDF via `IPdfRenderer`) |
| **Month 5 (Oct 2026)** | HMRC platform-operator registration · Stripe production approved · Marketing site live | **Phase 6** — Multi-user membership + auth sweep | **Refund / cancellation codification** in `Cancelled` workflow · **Per-contract VAT calculation** + **self-billed invoice generation** (reuses agreement PDF plumbing) · **OSA report-content flow** (button + email + policy doc) · **DAC7 export script** (defer the actual run until Jan 2028) |
| **Month 6 (Nov 2026)** | Beta cohort recruited (~10 venues + 50 artists) · Support process live · Pricing page live | Bugfixes from beta feedback · final integration tests | Final polish · accessibility quick-pass · **LAUNCH** |

## 4. Critical path

Dependencies that constrain the order:

```
Percentage commission decision (Month 1)
    └─→ Payment authorization package → platform sync → B2B gross calculators + pricing transparency (Month 3)
    └─→ Solicitor T&Cs drafting (Month 1-4)
            └─→ Privacy + T&Cs page routes (Month 4)
            └─→ Cookie banner final text (Month 4)
            └─→ Refund / cancellation codification (Month 5)

Phase 0 — Tenant scaffolding (Month 1)
    └─→ Phase 1 — Compliance value object (Month 1-2)
            └─→ Phase 2 — Venue/Artist FK (Month 2)
                    └─→ Phase 3 — Stripe re-key (Month 3)
                            └─→ Phase 4 — Booking snapshot (Month 4)
                                    └─→ Phase 5 — Setup UI (Month 4)
                                            └─→ Phase 6 — Membership refactor (Month 5)
                                                    └─→ Beta + launch (Month 6)

Stripe production approval (~2-4 weeks elapsed)
    └─→ Must be approved before Month 6 launch
```

**Hard gates that block launch:**
- Solicitor-drafted T&Cs in production (Month 4)
- ICO fee paid (Month 1)
- Stripe production approved (by Month 5)
- DAC7 fields collected for every paid seller (Month 4 onwards, soft gate)
- Insurance active (Month 3)

## 5. Swim-lane C — Compliance UI/UX work in detail

| Item | Effort | Depends on | Month |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRS correction in `LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` (✅ done 2026-06-01 — was "remove 3% line"; now per-tenant pass-through, venue's liability) | – | – | done |
| Music licence attestation field (on `Tenant.Compliance`) = PRS self-licensed flag | 0.5 days | Phase 1 | Month 1 |
| ✅ Tenant configuration surface (PRS / VAT / payment terms / cancellation defaults) | 1-2 days | Phase 1 | done |
| Booking agreement + click-wrap e-signature at Accept (snapshot terms, PDF via `IPdfRenderer`) — `LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` item 2 | 3-5 days | Phase 4 (Booking snapshot), `IPdfRenderer` | Month 4 |
| ✅ Per-contract-type VAT calculation (branches on supply direction + supplier VAT status) — items 1, 3 | 2-3 days | Tenant config (VAT fields) | done |
| ✅ Self-billed VAT invoice generation per settlement (sequential numbering, HMRC fields, PDF) — item 4 · self-billing *agreement* + renewal still outstanding | 2-3 days | VAT calculation, agreement PDF plumbing | done |
| ✅ Cookie consent banner on all four web SPAs (customer/venue/artist/business) — scaffolding, placeholder copy | 1-2 days | – (scaffolding can land before solicitor text) | done |
| Cookie banner text + privacy policy text from solicitor → wired into banner | 0.5 days | Solicitor draft (Month 4) | Month 4 |
| Percentage commission + pricing transparency at payer commitment (exact checkout + deferred settlement review) | 3 phases | Payment authorization package + platform sync | Month 3 |
| Privacy + T&Cs page routes (footer of every page) | 1 day | Solicitor draft | Month 4 |
| Venue legal details on emails (booking confirmation, invoices) | 1 day | Phase 5 (setup UI captures legal name) | Month 4 |
| Refund / cancellation matrix codification in `Cancelled` workflow | 3-5 days | Cancellation policy text from solicitor | Month 5 |
| Online Safety Act report-content flow (button + email destination + policy doc) | 1 day | – | Month 5 |
| DAC7 annual export script (writes XML in HMRC schema, doesn't run until Jan 2028) | 2-3 days | Phase 6 complete | Month 5 |

**Total Swim-lane C effort:** ~20-31 working days (up from ~12-19 after adding the booking-agreement, VAT-calculation, self-billed-invoice, and tenant-config items). Roughly 4-6 calendar weeks of focused work, spread across the 6 months because of dependency timing. The VAT chain (calculation → invoice) is the densest cluster and lands in Month 5 — watch it doesn't collide with the Phase 6 auth sweep (R6).

## 6. Risk register

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Tenancy refactor takes longer than 24 days (EF nested owned-types surprises, migration-script issues) | Medium | High | Phase 0 scaffolding has explicit go/no-go assessment at the end. If it took >3 days, recalibrate timeline before continuing. |
| R2 | Solicitor T&Cs drafting takes longer than 4 weeks | Medium | High | Brief solicitor in Month 1, not Month 3. Keep a parallel "draft v1" using a quality T&Cs template as backup. |
| R3 | Stripe production approval delayed (Stripe asks for more info / rejects) | Medium | High | Submit application Month 3, not Month 5. Have ICO fee + insurance + company info ready as supporting docs. |
| R4 | Pricing shown by B2B drifts from Payment's live fee before delayed settlement | Medium | High | Bind a Payment-issued authorization to an immutable Payment configuration revision and require that authorization on the eventual charge; never duplicate live fee config in B2B. |
| R5 | Beta cohort hard to recruit (no organic demand pre-launch) | Medium | Medium | Start recruitment Month 4 not Month 6. Hand-pick first 10 venues + 50 artists via warm intros, not open signups. |
| R6 | Phase 6 auth sweep introduces regressions across 25+ controllers | Medium | Medium | Test coverage assessment in Month 4. If integration test coverage is <60%, write tests first or split Phase 6 into smaller PRs. |
| R7 | DAC7 schema changes between now and first export (Jan 2028) | Low | Low | Defer DAC7 export *implementation* if HMRC publishes schema updates; keep onboarding field collection on-spec. |
| R8 | Solicitor flags an issue we haven't planned for (e.g. requires PSR registration, not just disclosed-agent) | Low | High | First solicitor consultation in Month 1 should explicitly confirm disclosed-agent posture is viable on Stripe Connect Express. If they push back, this plan needs major rework. |
| R9 | DoorSplit/Versus manual-entry settlement screen slips → two of four contract types unsellable at launch | Low | Medium | **Resolved 2026-06-22 (§9):** manual door-take entry + charge-the-venue feeds DoorSplit/Versus at v1 so all four ship; external-ticketer import ruled out; owned checkout (marketplace) is the deferred durable feed. Residual is only *building* the door-take entry screen — the money mechanic reuses FlatFee escrow. FlatFee + VenueHire remain the standalone floor if that screen slips. |
| R10 | VAT calculation + invoice work (Month 5) collides with Phase 6 auth sweep | Medium | Medium | Both land Month 5. If Phase 6 is running hot, pull the VAT chain forward to Month 4 (it depends only on the tenant VAT fields from Phase 1, not on Phase 6). |

## 7. Definition of "launch-ready"

Concrete checklist for Month 6. Don't launch without all of these green.

### Legal/business
- [ ] Limited company registered, PSC filed
- [ ] ICO fee paid for the current period
- [ ] Solicitor-drafted T&Cs live on the platform: Platform terms, Venue seller terms, Artist seller terms, Privacy policy, Cookie policy
- [ ] Refund + cancellation policy documented and codified in the `Cancelled` workflow
- [ ] DPA signed with Stripe; DPA template ready for venue/artist signing
- [ ] Insurance active (Professional Indemnity + Cyber)
- [ ] Accountant engaged; first quarterly review scheduled
- [ ] HMRC platform-operator registration filed (DAC7)
- [ ] Stripe production account approved + webhooks live

### Architecture
- [ ] Tenancy refactor merged and integration-tested (tenant-scoping done; membership + auth sweep per USER_MODEL_PLAN.md still outstanding)
- [ ] All Stripe Connect Express payouts flowing through TenantId
- [ ] ComplianceContext snapshot populated on every Booking created post-launch
- [ ] Auth checks routed through tenant membership (not legacy TPH FK)
- [x] Booking agreement generated + click-wrap consent recorded at every Accept
- [x] VAT calculated per contract type + self-billed invoice generated per settlement, gated on a current e-signed self-billing agreement (12-month renewal)
- [x] Tenant config surface live (PRS / VAT / payment terms read from it, not constants)
- [ ] Pre-launch dataset cleared / fresh seeded

### Compliance UI/UX
- [x] Cookie consent banner live on all four web SPAs (customer/venue/artist/business)
- [ ] Privacy + T&Cs pages accessible from every footer
- [ ] Pricing transparency on all four payer journeys (gross, platform fee and total shown before commitment)
- [ ] Venue legal details on booking confirmation emails + invoices
- [ ] Online Safety Act report-content button + email destination live

### Operational
- [ ] support@ inbox monitored; SLA documented (target: first response within 1 working day)
- [ ] Status page live
- [ ] Database backups verified
- [ ] Incident response process documented
- [ ] First 10 beta venues + 50 beta artists onboarded
- [ ] Marketing site live with pricing page

### Not required at launch
- Native mobile apps
- Multi-currency support
- Customer marketplace switch-on
- DAC7 export script *run* (first run isn't due until Jan 2028)
- Org-switcher / multi-org UX
- More granular membership roles

## 8. Marketplace add-on (post-launch)

The marketplace is **deliberately additive** — designed so it can be switched on later without major refactor of the B2B code paths.

See [MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md](../marketplace/MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md) for the detail. Headline:
- Most of the marketplace infrastructure already exists (Customer SPA, Customer module, TicketEntity, ConcertEntity price/capacity fields).
- Switch-on is primarily UI work (pricing transparency, refund UI, consumer-facing emails) + consumer-protection legal (separate customer T&Cs from solicitor + CMA secondary-ticketing review).
- The B2B tenancy refactor doesn't change; settlement workflows don't change; Stripe Connect doesn't change.
- Estimated effort when the time comes: ~2-3 calendar months.

**Earliest realistic marketplace switch-on:** Q1 2027 (3 months after B2B launch). Push later if B2B traction needs all the focus.

## 8b. Repo topology — stay monorepo until the polyrepo trigger fires (post-launch)

We stay on the **monorepo** through launch and well beyond. What we have is already a *monorepo of
independently-deployable services*, not a lazy monolith: package-clean service closures off the org
feed, `EnforceServiceBoundary` + `carve-*` CI gates, standalone AppHosts, and six read-only mirror
repos that already clone-and-build (see [../POLYREPO.md](../platform/POLYREPO.md) and
[../../api/ARCHITECTURE.md](../../api/ARCHITECTURE.md)). The split to a **true polyrepo** (mirrors
become the writable dev repos) is a **one-way door** — bias to cutting *late*, not on time.

The trigger is the **AND** of two conditions; the first alone is necessary but **not** sufficient:

1. **Cost gone (codebase milestone).** Post-launch, cross-service contracts frozen, `Shared`/`Kernel`
   core stopped churning, and the **cross-boundary commit rate down to ~single digits** (measured
   **~47%** pre-launch — half of `api/` commits touch >1 service; ~16% touch `Shared`). Above ~20% the
   publish→platform-sync→migrate tax bleeds you, and atomic cross-service changes stop being possible.
2. **A distinct owner (team milestone).** A second engineer owns a service end-to-end and is genuinely
   blocked by the shared merge stream or needs a hard source boundary. Polyrepo's payoff is *purely
   organizational* — with one person (+ agents) the monorepo is strictly better (atomic cross-service
   changes, trivial cross-service E2E, zero cross-repo tax), no matter how stable or large the code gets.

Stable-steady-state feature delivery makes a split *cheap and safe*; it does not make it *worth it*.
Worth-it waits on the second owner. Parallel-agent isolation is **not** a reason to split — worktrees
already give per-service isolation inside the monorepo, and a cross-cutting refactor is *harder* across
repos (N coordinated PRs + a sync), not easier.

When both fire, execute **service-by-service, cheapest-first** — `Auth`/`Payment` (stable adapters,
low co-change) before the churny `B2B`/`Customer`/`Shared` core — never big-bang. The mirrors already
build standalone, so each flip is mechanical (make the mirror writable, redirect dev, give it its own
copy of the workflows).

## 9. Decision points still open

The DoorSplit/Versus revenue source and revenue model are now locked in the decision log below. These
remaining operational choices are not urgent yet.

- **Beta cohort sourcing** — warm intros via existing music industry contacts? Cold outreach? Industry events? Decide by Month 4.
- **Support tooling** — shared inbox (Front, Helpscout) or just Gmail? Discord/Slack/WhatsApp for beta? Decide by Month 5.

## Decisions locked

The settled calls that constrain the work above. Full rationale + dated history are in git
(`git log -p plans/launch/LAUNCH_ROADMAP.md`) — not duplicated here.

- **B2B-first.** The customer ticket marketplace is deferred and additive (§8), not a v1 dependency.
- **All four contract types ship in v1.** DoorSplit/Versus settle via **manual door-take entry +
  charge-the-venue** — external-ticketer import ruled out; own checkout is the deferred durable feed. §9
- **Revenue model: one percentage of final deal gross.** B2B owns four deal-specific gross
  calculations; Payment owns the universal rate, binds it when the payer commits, charges commission
  on top of gross and records the retained amount in the ledger. No fixed/minimum/cap model remains
  after the launch cut-over. [PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md](PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md)
- **Monetization principle:** the fee always rides the settlement transaction routed through our
  Stripe Connect — never invoice-only (else there's no transaction to take a cut from). §9
- **Backend domain type is `Tenant`** (Guid PK, request-scoped filtering, compliance value object);
  **"Organization" is the user-facing UI/API label only.** Multi-user membership/roles/auth-sweep
  are the outstanding Swim-lane B work — see [USER_MODEL_PLAN.md](../b2b/USER_MODEL_PLAN.md).
