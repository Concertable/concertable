# Concertable Launch Roadmap

> **Roadmap** for the launch epic — the living progress tracker, not a plan (no `_PROGRESS.md`, never deleted, lives until launch). Each buildable item spins off its own feature plan; the roadmap tier is the `plans` skill.
>
> **Goal:** Production launch of the B2B platform (venue↔artist booking + automated settlement) by **November 2026**.
>
> **Companion docs:** [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md), [USER_MODEL_PLAN.md](../b2b/USER_MODEL_PLAN.md), [MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md](../marketplace/MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md), [../../api/Concertable.B2B/src/Modules/Deal/LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md](../../api/Concertable.B2B/src/Modules/Deal/LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Status — what's shipped vs. what's left

**Shipped — verified in code, don't rebuild:** Tenant model + membership + 6-role RBAC · payout re-keyed to `TenantId` · Stripe Connect Express with both money flows (escrow `OnBehalfOf` for FlatFee/VenueHire; `TransferData.Destination` for DoorSplit/Versus) · temporary Payment-owned £10 platform fee on all four settlement types · append-only balanced Payment ledger · artist↔venue messaging · settlement for all four contract types · the 3% PRS skim is correctly absent.

**Decisions locked (see §9 / decision log):**
- [x] Revenue model — **resolved for launch 2026-07-30: one Payment-owned percentage of the final B2B-calculated deal gross.** The payer pays gross plus commission and the payee receives gross. B2B owns four deal-gross strategies; Payment owns one deal-agnostic commission calculation. The shipped £10 fee is temporary and must be removed before launch. See [PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md](PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md) and the decision log.
- [x] DoorSplit/Versus revenue source — **resolved: manual door-takings entry + charge-the-venue** for v1 (external-ticketer import ruled out — §9). All four contract types ship in the pure-B2B MVP, no marketplace dependency. See §9 / R9.

**Code sweep 2026-08-16 — eight previously untracked gaps.** A verification pass over the admin,
tenant-verification, Stripe-webhook, GDPR, rate-limiting and audit surfaces found work the roadmap had
never listed: four launch gates (webhook coverage, tenant verification, admin console, GDPR subject
rights), rate limiting, the open settlement-dispute decision in §9, and two post-launch rows (email
preferences, admin audit log). They are folded into the lists below and into §5/§7/§9 with their
code evidence inline, rather than kept as a separate appendix. The three "verify before trusting"
table-stakes items were resolved in the same pass.

**Build — MVP blockers, in priority order:**
- [x] ✅ **Concert cancellation + escrow refund** — cancel a *booked concert* (escrow `Held`): `Booked → Cancelled` + refund. Wires `EscrowEntity.Refund()` (the method existed; B2B never called it). Shipped in PR #76 (concert-cancel path across all four contract types, venue SPA cancel action, API + UI E2E). **This is the concert-cancel path only** — application-cancel below is still open.
- [x] ✅ **Application cancellation** — shipped (`Feature/ApplicationCancel`): artist **withdraw** + venue **reject** from `Applied`; venue **cancel** / artist withdraw from `Accepted`/`PaymentFailed` → terminal `Cancelled` with the escrow unwind via the existing `RefundByBookingIdAsync` (no new Payment capability), late-capture compensation for the 3DS-window race, opportunity re-opens on cancel (application- and concert-cancel alike), HATEOAS-gated actions in both manager SPAs (venue Deny/Cancel; artist My Applications page + Withdraw). Optional FlatFee hold-release RPC deliberately skipped — orphaned accept-checkout holds self-expire in ~7 days (logged in [api/TECH_DEBT.md](../../api/TECH_DEBT.md)).
- [x] ✅ **E-signed booking agreement** — shipped (`Feature/BookingAgreement`): click-wrap consent at Apply + Accept, agreed terms snapshotted at Accept (immutable `BookingAgreementEntity`, terms-fingerprint guard against mid-flight edits), PDF via `IPdfRenderer` (`BookingAgreementDocument`, generated background-at-Accept with a lazy render-on-download fallback, stored under the `agreements/` blob prefix), both-party-authorized `GET /api/Application/{id}/agreement` + `/agreement/pdf` endpoints, HATEOAS `agreement` link, download links in both manager SPAs. **Advanced-tier self-hosted e-signature** (typed full name required + optional drawn signature, rendered into the PDF Signatures block; no third party / no per-signature cost) — upgraded from the original Tier 1 click-wrap. LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS item 2.
- [x] ✅ **DoorSplit/Versus door-take entry at settlement** — shipped (`Feature/DoorRevenueSettlement`): the venue declares the **external** door take on an ended, still-`Booked` revenue-share concert (`POST /api/Concert/{id}/door-revenue`, venue-tenant guarded, HATEOAS-gated "Enter door takings" action in the venue SPA). Settlement charges the artist's % of **`TicketsSold × Price + DoorRevenue`** — Concertable's own ticket sales **plus** the declared external take, never either alone. The "awaiting declaration" rule is single-sourced via a composable `PredicateSpecification` combinator (published to Kernel, platform `.576`), shared by the completion sweep and a backend `AwaitingDoorRevenue` KPI. **All four contract types now settle.** See §1 / R9.
- [x] ✅ **DAC7 onboarding completion** — shipped (`Feature/Dac7Onboarding`): fail-closed DAC7 payout gate + jurisdiction seam (UK-only, keyed strategy) + tax-details nag on both dashboards; VAT collapsed to a single number. NINO / UTR / Company-Reg on `Tenant.Compliance`; no payout until the payee tenant is jurisdiction-complete (no de-minimis for services — reportable from £1).
- [x] ✅ **Self-billed VAT invoice engine** — complete (`Feature/VatAndSelfBilledInvoicing` + `Feature/SelfBillingAgreement`): invoice generation (per-settlement immutable invoice, gap-free per-supplier numbering, VAT-status branching (inclusive-gross decompose), HMRC self-billing legends + both parties' VAT numbers, PDF via `IPdfRenderer` lazy render-on-download `invoices/` prefix, two-party-scoped `GET /api/Concert/{id}/invoice[/pdf]` + HATEOAS link — items 1, 3, 4) **plus** the per-supplier self-billing *agreement* + 12-month renewal consent: immutable e-signed `SelfBillingAgreementEntity` (single-owner, frozen identity + supplier e-signature, `ExpiresAtUtc = AcceptedAtUtc + 12 months`, lazy PDF under `self-billing-agreements/`), append-only grant/renew surface in both manager SPAs (HATEOAS grant/renew/pdf + dashboard nag), and a **fail-closed settlement gate** — `FinishExecutor` mints no self-billed invoice unless the supplier holds a current agreement, deferring + self-healing on the hourly sweep exactly like the tax-compliance gate. The invoice's "raised under a self-billing agreement" legend is now always truthful.
- [x] ✅ **`holdsMusicLicence` attestation** `launch/music-licence-attestation` on `Tenant.Compliance` — shipped (`Feature/launch_music-licence-attestation`): one `bool` on the shipped `TaxCompliance` VO, threaded through the org read/update DTO + mapper and the b2b/shared Org setup form (new "Music licence" checkbox). Record-only — the venue's responsibility; no verification, no payout/booking gate.
- [x] ✅ **Manager front-page dashboards** — shipped in PR #563: live Venue and Artist manager workbenches, role-specific application actions, contract downloads, authenticated desktop/tablet/mobile acceptance, and durable IPv4/shared development-certificate setup. Exact-head and merge-group CI passed, including API and both UI E2E suites; packages published successfully and platform sync `0.1.0-alpha.0.1133` merged in PR #730.
- [x] ✅ **Swim-lane B complete** — membership/invitation endpoints + auth sweep + messaging group-inbox (USER_MODEL_PLAN Phases 6-8, all shipped; plan deleted). **Phase 6** (`Feature/TenantInvitationsFrontend`): invitation endpoints + last-Owner invariants + provisioning invitation-first branch + member-management UI + tenant switcher + UI E2E. **Phase 8** (`Feature/MessagingGroupInbox` + `Feature/MessagingGroupInboxPhase2`): tenant-owned conversations, per-member read pointer, member SignalR + email fan-out, org-identity/member-attribution DTO + group-inbox SPA, new Conversations unit/integration + UI E2E. **Phase 7** (`Feature/RetireRoleClaim`): retired the flat `Role` enum, manager-profile tables, and the `role` token claim — B2B tokens are identity-only; `/me` collapsed to one membership-shaped DTO; guards/persona derive from tenant memberships.
- [x] ✅ **Per-contract-type VAT calculation** — shipped (`Feature/VatAndSelfBilledInvoicing`): inclusive-gross decomposition branching on supply direction + supplier VAT-registration status, in the Tenant tax area, consumed by Concert via `ITenantModule` (items 1, 3).
- [ ] 🟠 **Percentage commission + B2B pricing transparency** `launch/platform-commission` — Payment Phases 1 and 1b are merged, published and synced. Phase 1: immutable percentage revisions, Payment-issued bindings, binding-aware money RPCs, durable transaction/refund/tax/ledger facts. Phase 1b (landed 2026-08-07 via PR #392, which absorbed and superseded PR #296): caller-supplied commission and total removed from every post-binding action — bound calculation and money-movement requests reserve `expected_commission_minor`/`expected_payer_total_minor`, and `ConfirmReviewedGross` is the sole reviewed-amount boundary; the breaking package published and platform sync migrated B2B/Customer consumers. **Phase 2 is now the active work**: the four B2B keyed gross strategies, the frozen final-gross snapshot for deferred deals, routing all four payment journeys through the binding-aware Payment methods, and payer/artist disclosure in the manager SPAs. The temporary £10 seam is removed only in Phase 3. See [PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md](PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md).
- [x] ✅ **Browser-storage audit + consent correction** `launch/browser-storage-consent` — shipped (`Feature/launch_browser-storage-consent`, #482): evidence-led audit (static sweep + anonymous runtime capture) of the four SPAs' device storage, every item classified necessary/functional/optional in a drift-guarded `app/web/shared/src/lib/storageManifest.ts` and the engineering inventory `app/web/shared/BROWSER_STORAGE.md`. Removed the dead `sidebar_state` cookie; made the two boot-time third parties load on use only (lazy Stripe `getStripe()`; Google Maps via a scoped `MapsProvider` on find/detail routes, no longer at app boot); added `consentGate.ts` so the retained analytics/marketing banner's toggles actually gate loading (the integration point for roadmapped GA4/pixels). Banner retained by decision — analytics/marketing is roadmapped and UK PECR mandates the banner once such tech loads. Legal-gated tail only: solicitor policy-copy wire into the `/cookies` page (separate item, line 198) and whether Maps needs a `functional` consent category.
- [ ] 🔴 **Stripe webhook coverage — disputes, account status, money-movement failures** `launch/stripe-webhook-coverage` — surfaced by the 2026-08-16 sweep. Payment handles exactly four events (`payment_intent.succeeded|payment_failed`, `setup_intent.succeeded|setup_failed`); [../payments/PROVIDER_CONTRACT_BASELINE_PLAN.md](../payments/PROVIDER_CONTRACT_BASELINE_PLAN.md) confirms "only succeeded/failed subsets are handled today" and puts full webhook handling **outside its own scope**, so nothing owns this. Unhandled: **`charge.dispute.created`** — chargebacks are invisible, and `EscrowStatus.Disputed` is an enum value nothing ever sets; **`account.updated`** — a connected account losing its payouts capability is never detected, so settlement keeps routing money at a restricted account; **`payout.failed`/`transfer.failed`** — silent money failures. Hard gate: this is real money on the differentiating settlement path. Sequence after the Payment provider-contract baseline so normalized states and transition legality land first.
- [x] ✅ **Tenant verification — venue and artist legitimacy** `launch/tenant-verification` — shipped across six phases. Replaces the decorative `VenueEntity.Approved` bool with a real `TenantVerificationEntity` state machine (Pending/Approved/Rejected, append-only evidence) owned by the Tenant module, so it covers artists too. Phase 1 (#772): the domain + migration. Phase 2 (#784): tenant-facing submit API — evidence upload (licence / proof of address / company registration) via `IBlobStorageService` on its own `verification-evidence/` prefix, content-type + magic-byte + size validation. Phase 3 (#792): `ITenantModule.IsVerifiedAsync` (fail-closed), **enforced** at `OpportunityService.CreateAsync`/`CreateMultipleAsync` (unverified venue can't publish → `opportunity.venue_not_verified`) and `FinishExecutor.FinishAsync` (unverified party → `SettlementOutcome.DeferredPendingVerification`, self-heals on the hourly sweep). Phase 4 (#799): `[Admin]` pending-queue / approve / reject-with-reason on `VerificationController`, `IVenueModule`/`IArtistModule.GetContactByTenantIdAsync` for the enriched queue, `IVerificationNotifier` email on decision. Phase 5 (#825 publish + #824): admin `features/verification` SPA + the tenant-facing `VerificationBanner` + `VerificationForm` in `app/web/b2b/shared`, `/settings/verification` routes. Phase 6 (#824): removed `VenueEntity.Approved`, the `[Admin]` approve/`pending-approval` endpoints, `ApproveVenueError`, `PendingVenue`, the dead `VenuePrivileged*` chain, and `app/web/admin/features/venues/`.
- [x] ✅ **Admin console + production admin provisioning** `launch/admin-console` — shipped across four phases. Phase 1 (#624): invitation-or-bootstrap admin provisioning, granted post-login (`AdminService.EnsureCurrentUserAdminGrantedIfEligibleAsync` off `GET /api/auth/me`, not the raw unverified registration event) so a self-serve "become an admin" path never opens. Phase 2 (#648): new top-level `app/web/admin` SPA, its own Duende client, admin invite/revoke UI. Phase 3 (#722): moderation UI wired to the existing `ModerationController`. Phase 4 (#737): venue-approval UI — new `[Admin]`-gated `GET /api/venue/pending-approval` plus the pending-venues list/approve UI, closing the loop `VenueEntity.Approved` needed. The already-shipped OSA moderation and venue-approval backends are reachable in production for the first time. Unblocked the tenant-verification gate below — **which then replaced Phase 4's venue-approval surface entirely** (`tenant-verification` Phase 6, #824): `VenueEntity.Approved`, `GET /api/venue/pending-approval`, `PATCH /api/venue/{id}/approve` and `app/web/admin/features/venues/` are gone, superseded by `features/verification`.
- [ ] 🔴 **GDPR subject rights — erasure + data export** `launch/gdpr-subject-rights` — surfaced by the 2026-08-16 sweep. No account deletion, data export or anonymisation anywhere in `api/` or `app/`; the roadmap tracks the ICO *fee* but no DSAR capability. Not a `DELETE` endpoint: settled invoices, self-billing agreements and ledger entries are HMRC-retained for six years, so this needs a designed retain-vs-erase split (anonymise the identity, keep the financial record), an export format, and a documented response SLA.
- [x] ✅ **API rate limiting** `launch/rate-limiting` — shipped (`Feature/launch_rate-limiting`) as an opt-in seam in `Concertable.ServiceDefaults` (`AddDefaultRateLimiting`/`AddRateLimitPolicy`/`UseDefaultRateLimiting`, 429 + `Retry-After`, per-`sub` or per-IP fixed-window partitioning, lazy per-policy config binding; producer #655 + platform-sync #663) plus named policies applied across all five web hosts on the ~36 real abuse surfaces the sweep identified (credential/change-password, public reads, blob upload, apply/messaging/checkout, profile-image, purchase/review, search, setup-intent). Opt-in, no global fallback — evidence and rationale in the shipping PRs #655 (producer seam) + #670 (consumers across all five hosts). In-process only (distributed store deferred) and three adjacent anonymous-endpoint auth gaps logged in [api/TECH_DEBT.md](../../api/TECH_DEBT.md).
- [ ] 🔴 **Production deployment + config/secrets** — the app has **no** deployment path, config store, or secret store (all local Aspire + emulators; secrets committed to source, incl. a plaintext Azure SQL password). Surfaced 2026-07-17. Hard launch gate. Plan: [../CONFIG_AND_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md](../platform/CONFIG_AND_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md).

**Architecture refactors — ready, not launch gates:**

- [x] ✅ **Deal-type strategy registration** — shipped in PR #451: module-local factories and vertically declared registration replace the repeated `DealType → strategy` dictionaries while preserving named business facades and the Deal/Concert boundary. `launch/deal-strategy-registration`
- [ ] 🟡 **Deal representation and common-interface dispatch** `launch/deal-closed-sum-model` — immediate architecture owner before lifecycle PR #633 resumes. First land the B2B-local generator/analyzer and Deal-owned mapper/updater net10 foundation from current `main`; then PR #633 consumes it for Application terms and heterogeneous operation factories. One reusable generator template emits invariant common-interface factories and dedicated union factories while each runtime factory remains module-owned. Heterogeneous operations use Dunet implementation unions on net10 and native implementation unions on C# 15; consumers match operation kind and multiple Deals may share one implementation. The later .NET 11 cut-over closes the published Deal hierarchy without changing consumer factory APIs. Plan: [DEAL_CLOSED_SUM_MODEL_PLAN.md](DEAL_CLOSED_SUM_MODEL_PLAN.md).
- [ ] 🔴 **Application → Booking → Concert module ownership** `launch/deal-lifecycle-ownership` — design approved 2026-08-16; PR #633 carries the whole decomposition and is merging through the merge queue, consuming the now-terminal Deal generator/mapper/updater foundation (#678/#694) and Kernel state machine (#719/#730) directly. Split the current
  Concert umbrella into honest Opportunity, Application, Booking/Contract, and Concert ownership;
  each lifecycle aggregate owns independent state, transitions, and contextual operations. Its current
  keyed selectors are provisional delivery seams owned for replacement by the Deal dispatch plan:
  honest same-interface mapper/updater/terms families use generated invariant factories, while
  heterogeneous lifecycle operations use dedicated typed factories plus implementation-union matches;
  multiple Deals may share one operation implementation; identical behavior is direct and
  static variation is data. The fixed
  stage order never varies by `DealType`; no umbrella process entity, shared
  workflow module, cross-module state machine, Deal-owned orchestration, or Rust decision engine is
  allowed. The remaining decomposition lands as one complete PR; its implementation phases are draft-
  branch checkpoints, not separately mergeable slices. Split only if a real published-package or
  deployment dependency appears. The follow-on .NET 11 slice owns native unions for closed internal
  values and module-local heterogeneous operation choices; typed factories own DI construction and no
  union performs service resolution or restores the global workflow. See
  [DEAL_LIFECYCLE_OWNERSHIP_PLAN.md](DEAL_LIFECYCLE_OWNERSHIP_PLAN.md).
- [ ] 🟡 **Payment operation ownership** `launch/payment-operation-ownership` — publish Payment's final consumer-agnostic surface in one breaking release: durable operation references, provider-identifier ownership, reference-keyed escrow/ledger/settlement, legacy raw-identifier removal, and payment-owned vocabulary. B2B and Customer then migrate directly from the old surface once. See [PAYMENT_METHOD_COMMITMENTS_PLAN.md](PAYMENT_METHOD_COMMITMENTS_PLAN.md).
- [x] ✅ **Customer payment-reference migration** `launch/customer-payment-reference` — Customer ticket purchase now runs on-session Payment sessions addressed by whole Customer-minted operation references; provider identifiers no longer cross or persist at the Customer boundary. Delivered by PRs #939 and #938.

- [ ] 🟡 **Lifecycle reporting read projections** `launch/lifecycle-read-projections` — deferred until
  the lifecycle ownership refactor is terminal. Replace the Application dashboard's transitive
  Opportunity query with a narrow Application-owned, event-fed availability projection while keeping
  Apply, Accept, checkout, and invariant decisions on authoritative synchronous reads. This is a
  selective reporting boundary, not a Dashboard-wide database or a rule to denormalize every reverse
  read. See [LIFECYCLE_READ_PROJECTIONS_PLAN.md](LIFECYCLE_READ_PROJECTIONS_PLAN.md).

**Competitor table-stakes — verified ABSENT 2026-08-16 (was "verify before trusting"):**

- **B2B reviews/reputation** `launch/b2b-reviews` — `IVenueReviewService`/`IArtistReviewService` in B2B are read-only projections over *fan* reviews (rows keyed by `Email`). There is no venue↔artist post-gig review submission anywhere.
- **Calendar sync** (Google/Apple/Outlook) `launch/calendar-sync` — nothing, not even an ICS feed.
- **Financial/settlement CSV export** `launch/settlement-export` — zero occurrences in `api/`.

None is a launch gate. All three are post-launch competitive parity unless a beta venue demands one.

The legal/business track is [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md); the hard launch gates are in §7.

## 1. Vision and scope

**In scope for the v1 launch:**
- B2B SaaS marketplace for venue↔artist bookings
- Four contract types (FlatFee, DoorSplit, VenueHire, Versus)
- Automated settlement via Stripe Connect Express
- Disclosed-agent legal posture (Concertable acts as venue/artist's agent for money handling)
- Multi-staff Tenant model (Owner + Manager roles)
- DAC7-compliant seller onboarding
- Cancellation/refund handling on the B2B path (venue or artist cancels — escrow refunds correctly)
- Per-booking signed agreement (click-wrap e-signature, terms snapshotted at Accept) — see [LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md](../../api/Concertable.B2B/src/Modules/Deal/LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md) item 2
- Per-contract-type VAT calculation + VAT-compliant self-billed invoices per settlement (items 1, 3, 4)
- Per-tenant configuration surface (PRS, VAT, payment terms, cancellation defaults). The platform fee is Payment-owned platform configuration, not a tenant override.

**DoorSplit/Versus revenue source — resolved (2026-06-22):** these two settle against door/ticket revenue, which standalone B2B (no marketplace) has no automatic feed for. The confirmed v1 feed is **manual door-take entry + charge-the-venue**: the venue enters the door take at settlement, Concertable charges the venue for the artist's share (+ our fee) and pays the artist through Stripe Connect — identical to FlatFee escrow. So **all four contract types ship in the pure-B2B MVP** with no marketplace dependency. The own checkout (deferred) only *upgrades* DoorSplit/Versus later (verified number instead of self-reported, no venue credit risk). See §9.

**Out of scope for v1 (planned, not abandoned):**
- Customer-facing ticket marketplace — see [MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md](../marketplace/MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md). Designed to be additive; switch-on planned Q1 2027 or later once B2B has traction.
- Mobile app distribution to App Store / Play Store
- Native push notifications
- Multi-currency / international expansion
- More granular membership roles beyond Owner/Manager
- Org-switcher UI (one user managing multiple orgs)

**The differentiation thesis:** GigPig and GigXchange are flat-fee booking tools — GigPig even markets automated payments and a "Payment House" that splits one venue payment across artists (2026 site copy) — so *flat-fee* booking + auto-payout is table stakes, not a moat. Concertable's edge is **settling the revenue-share contract types (DoorSplit/Versus), which neither competitor does**: the door take is entered at settlement and the artist's share moves through our own Stripe Connect (charge the venue → pay the artist). Crucially this needs **no ticketing ownership** — manual door-take entry + charge-the-venue is enough — so the moat is the typed revenue-share *settlement*, not a ticketing platform. Unlike DICE (closed, ticketing-first), Concertable also owns the venue↔artist booking + contract workflow. **That is the whole MVP thesis: out-compete GigPig/GigXchange on the contract types they structurally can't settle** — which is why DoorSplit/Versus must be sellable at v1 (now resolved via manual entry, §9), not deferred.

## 2. Three parallel swim-lanes

Three workstreams run in parallel across the six months. Each has different owners and dependencies.

### Swim-lane A — Legal & Business
**Owner:** you (with solicitor + accountant)
**Detail:** [LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md](LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md)

Company registration, ICO, T&Cs, insurance, accounting, HMRC platform-operator registration, Stripe production activation. Mostly admin work scattered across the six months; some elapsed-time dependencies (solicitor drafting takes 2-4 weeks).

### Swim-lane B — Architecture
**Owner:** you (or contractor dev)
**Detail:** [USER_MODEL_PLAN.md](../b2b/USER_MODEL_PLAN.md)

The tenancy refactor — the load-bearing structural change that everything else attaches to, sequenced as the phases in the timeline below. The tenant-scoping foundation (Tenant module with a Guid PK, request-scoped tenant filtering, the compliance value object) has shipped; the outstanding work — multi-user membership, roles, and the authorization sweep — is tracked in [USER_MODEL_PLAN.md](../b2b/USER_MODEL_PLAN.md).

### Swim-lane C — Compliance UI/UX + workflow polish
**Owner:** you (or contractor dev)
**Detail:** §5 of this plan

The smaller code items that don't fit in either of the other swim-lanes: browser-storage audit and consent correction, pricing transparency, refund/cancellation codification, DAC7 export script, legal-page routes, OSA report-content flow, etc. Some items block on legal text (T&Cs) being drafted first; others can run earlier.

## 3. 6-month timeline

Calendar-realistic, not optimistic. Slips are flagged as risks (§6).

| Month | Swim-lane A (Legal/Business) | Swim-lane B (Architecture) | Swim-lane C (Compliance UI/UX) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Month 1 (Jun 2026)** | Company registered (Companies House, ~£12, 24hr) · ICO fee paid (~£40-60/yr) · Solicitor engaged + briefed for T&Cs · **Revenue model decided** · **DoorSplit/Versus revenue-source decision** (§9) | **Phase 0** — `Tenant` module scaffolding · **Phase 1** — `ComplianceContext` value object + tenant config surface | **Music licence attestation field** spec (= PRS self-licensed flag; wired in Phase 1) · _(PRS correction in `LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` ✅ done 2026-06-01)_ |
| **Month 2 (Jul 2026)** | Business bank account opened · Accountant engaged · Solicitor drafts circulating | **Phase 2** — Venue/Artist wired to Tenant | Browser-storage inventory + policy classification; consent only where actual optional technology requires it |
| **Month 3 (Aug 2026)** | Insurance arranged (Professional Indemnity + Cyber) · Stripe production application submitted | **Phase 3** — `PayoutAccountEntity` re-key to TenantId | **Pricing transparency** at each payer commitment point (Payment quote package first) |
| **Month 4 (Sep 2026)** | Solicitor T&Cs finalised · DPA signed with Stripe · ICO documentation (privacy policy, lawful basis, retention) | **Phase 4** — `ComplianceContext` snapshot on Booking · **Phase 5** — Organization setup UI | **Privacy + T&Cs page routes** wired up (solicitor text now in hand) · **Venue legal details on emails** template change · **Booking agreement + click-wrap e-sign** at Accept (PDF via `IPdfRenderer`) |
| **Month 5 (Oct 2026)** | HMRC platform-operator registration · Stripe production approved · Marketing site live | **Phase 6** — Multi-user membership + auth sweep · **Admin console + admin provisioning** · **Tenant verification** (needs the console) | **Refund / cancellation codification** in `Cancelled` workflow · **Per-contract VAT calculation** + **self-billed invoice generation** (reuses agreement PDF plumbing) · **OSA report-content flow** (button + email + policy doc) · **DAC7 export script** (defer the actual run until Jan 2028) |
| **Month 6 (Nov 2026)** | Beta cohort recruited (~10 venues + 50 artists) · Support process live · Pricing page live | Bugfixes from beta feedback · final integration tests | **Stripe webhook coverage** (disputes / account status / payout failures) · **GDPR erasure + export** · **Rate limiting** · Final polish · accessibility quick-pass · **LAUNCH** |

## 4. Critical path

Dependencies that constrain the order:

```
Percentage commission decision (Month 1)
    └─→ Payment binding package → platform sync → B2B gross calculators + pricing transparency (Month 3)
    └─→ Solicitor T&Cs drafting (Month 1-4)
            └─→ Privacy + T&Cs page routes (Month 4)
            └─→ Refund / cancellation codification (Month 5)

Browser-storage inventory (anonymous → authenticated → Stripe checkout)
    └─→ remove unjustified storage + classify necessary Auth/Stripe storage
            └─→ cookie/storage policy (solicitor-reviewed)
            └─→ consent mechanism only for actual non-exempt optional technology

Phase 0 — Tenant scaffolding (Month 1)
    └─→ Phase 1 — Compliance value object (Month 1-2)
            └─→ Phase 2 — Venue/Artist FK (Month 2)
                    └─→ Phase 3 — Stripe re-key (Month 3)
                            └─→ Phase 4 — Booking snapshot (Month 4)
                                    └─→ Phase 5 — Setup UI (Month 4)
                                            └─→ Phase 6 — Membership refactor (Month 5)
                                                    └─→ Beta + launch (Month 6)

Admin console + production admin provisioning (Month 5)
    └─→ Tenant verification (evidence upload + admin review + enforced gate)

Payment provider-contract baseline
    └─→ Stripe webhook coverage (disputes, account.updated, payout/transfer failures)

Stripe production approval (~2-4 weeks elapsed)
    └─→ Must be approved before Month 6 launch
```

**Hard gates that block launch:**
- Solicitor-drafted T&Cs in production (Month 4)
- ICO fee paid (Month 1)
- Stripe production approved (by Month 5)
- DAC7 fields collected for every paid seller (Month 4 onwards, soft gate)
- Insurance active (Month 3)

## 5. Swim-lane C — Compliance UI/UX work in detail

| Item | Effort | Depends on | Month |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRS correction in `LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` (✅ done 2026-06-01 — was "remove 3% line"; now per-tenant pass-through, venue's liability) | – | – | done |
| Music licence attestation field (on `Tenant.Compliance`) = PRS self-licensed flag | 0.5 days | Phase 1 | Month 1 |
| Tenant configuration surface (PRS / VAT / payment terms / cancellation defaults) | 1-2 days | Phase 1 | Month 1-2 |
| Booking agreement + click-wrap e-signature at Accept (snapshot terms, PDF via `IPdfRenderer`) — `LEGAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` item 2 | 3-5 days | Phase 4 (Booking snapshot), `IPdfRenderer` | Month 4 |
| ✅ Per-contract-type VAT calculation (branches on supply direction + supplier VAT status) — items 1, 3 | 2-3 days | Tenant config (VAT fields) | done |
| ✅ Self-billed VAT invoice generation per settlement (sequential numbering, HMRC fields, PDF) — item 4 · self-billing *agreement* + renewal still outstanding | 2-3 days | VAT calculation, agreement PDF plumbing | done |
| Browser-storage audit + consent correction across all four web SPAs; remove unjustified storage/scaffolding and document or gate what remains | TBD by feature plan | Browser evidence + solicitor classification | Pre-launch |
| Percentage commission + pricing transparency at payer commitment (exact checkout + deferred settlement review) | 3 phases | Payment binding package + platform sync | Month 3 |

| ✅ Online Safety Act report-content flow — in-app report route, persisted report record, acknowledgement + safety-inbox emails, and admin moderation (hide/restore/resolve). The published `report@`/`safety@` fallback ships with the footer legal pages (solicitor-gated), so the reporting route is not fully closed | 1 day | – | done |
| Tenant suspension as an admin enforcement action (suspension state enforced at membership resolution; held escrow + pending payouts resolved explicitly per booking) — split out of the OSA report-content work 2026-08-14: suspending a paying customer needs the illegal-content **enforcement clause in the T&Cs**, which is solicitor-owned and does not exist yet | 2-3 days | T&Cs enforcement clause **[LEGAL]** | Post-solicitor |

| DAC7 annual export script (writes XML in HMRC schema, doesn't run until Jan 2028) | 2-3 days | Phase 6 complete | Month 5 |

**Total Swim-lane C effort:** ~40-60 working days (up from ~20-31 after the 2026-08-16 sweep added the admin-console, tenant-verification, webhook-coverage, GDPR, rate-limiting, dispute-path, email-preferences and audit-log rows). Roughly 8-12 calendar weeks of focused work, spread across the 6 months because of dependency timing — the sweep roughly doubled this lane, so the Month 5-6 window is now the binding constraint, not the VAT chain. The VAT chain (calculation → invoice) remains the densest legacy cluster in Month 5 — watch it doesn't collide with the Phase 6 auth sweep (R6).

## 6. Risk register

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Tenancy refactor takes longer than 24 days (EF nested owned-types surprises, migration-script issues) | Medium | High | Phase 0 scaffolding has explicit go/no-go assessment at the end. If it took >3 days, recalibrate timeline before continuing. |
| R2 | Solicitor T&Cs drafting takes longer than 4 weeks | Medium | High | Brief solicitor in Month 1, not Month 3. Keep a parallel "draft v1" using a quality T&Cs template as backup. |
| R3 | Stripe production approval delayed (Stripe asks for more info / rejects) | Medium | High | Submit application Month 3, not Month 5. Have ICO fee + insurance + company info ready as supporting docs. |
| R4 | Pricing shown by B2B drifts from Payment's live fee before delayed settlement | Medium | High | Require a Payment-issued binding to an immutable Payment configuration revision on the eventual charge; never duplicate live fee config in B2B. |
| R5 | Beta cohort hard to recruit (no organic demand pre-launch) | Medium | Medium | Start recruitment Month 4 not Month 6. Hand-pick first 10 venues + 50 artists via warm intros, not open signups. |
| R6 | Phase 6 auth sweep introduces regressions across 25+ controllers | Medium | Medium | Test coverage assessment in Month 4. If integration test coverage is <60%, write tests first or split Phase 6 into smaller PRs. |
| R7 | DAC7 schema changes between now and first export (Jan 2028) | Low | Low | Defer DAC7 export *implementation* if HMRC publishes schema updates; keep onboarding field collection on-spec. |
| R8 | Solicitor flags an issue we haven't planned for (e.g. requires PSR registration, not just disclosed-agent) | Low | High | First solicitor consultation in Month 1 should explicitly confirm disclosed-agent posture is viable on Stripe Connect Express. If they push back, this plan needs major rework. |
| R9 | DoorSplit/Versus manual-entry settlement screen slips → two of four contract types unsellable at launch | Low | Medium | **Resolved 2026-06-22 (§9):** manual door-take entry + charge-the-venue feeds DoorSplit/Versus at v1 so all four ship; external-ticketer import ruled out; owned checkout (marketplace) is the deferred durable feed. Residual is only *building* the door-take entry screen — the money mechanic reuses FlatFee escrow. FlatFee + VenueHire remain the standalone floor if that screen slips. |
| R10 | VAT calculation + invoice work (Month 5) collides with Phase 6 auth sweep | Medium | Medium | Both land Month 5. If Phase 6 is running hot, pull the VAT chain forward to Month 4 (it depends only on the tenant VAT fields from Phase 1, not on Phase 6). |
| R11 | The 2026-08-16 sweep roughly doubled Swim-lane C (~20-31 → ~40-60 days) against a fixed November 2026 date, and four of the additions are launch gates landing in Months 5-6 — the same window as the Phase 6 auth sweep and production deployment | **High** | **High** | The lane no longer fits its window on current sequencing. Either move the launch date, or cut scope explicitly: the honest candidates are shipping tenant verification as manual/offline admin review (evidence by email, flag flipped by hand) rather than a built upload workflow, and deferring rate limiting to a CDN/gateway rule. Do **not** cut the webhook-coverage or GDPR gates — the first is money correctness on the differentiating path, the second is a regulator obligation. Reassess at the end of Month 4. |

## 7. Definition of "launch-ready"

Concrete checklist for Month 6. Don't launch without all of these green.

### Legal/business
- [ ] Limited company registered, PSC filed
- [ ] ICO fee paid for the current period
- [ ] Solicitor-drafted T&Cs live on the platform: Platform terms, Venue seller terms, Artist seller terms, Privacy policy, Cookie policy
- [ ] Refund + cancellation policy documented and codified in the `Cancelled` workflow
- [ ] DPA signed with Stripe; DPA template ready for venue/artist signing
- [ ] Insurance active (Professional Indemnity + Cyber)
- [ ] Accountant engaged; first quarterly review scheduled
- [ ] HMRC platform-operator registration filed (DAC7)
- [ ] Stripe production account approved + webhooks live

### Architecture
- [ ] Tenancy refactor merged and integration-tested (tenant-scoping done; membership + auth sweep per USER_MODEL_PLAN.md still outstanding)
- [ ] All Stripe Connect Express payouts flowing through TenantId
- [ ] ComplianceContext snapshot populated on every Booking created post-launch
- [ ] Auth checks routed through tenant membership (not legacy TPH FK)
- [x] Booking agreement generated + click-wrap consent recorded at every Accept
- [x] VAT calculated per contract type + self-billed invoice generated per settlement, gated on a current e-signed self-billing agreement (12-month renewal)
- [ ] Tenant config surface live (PRS / VAT / payment terms read from it, not constants)
- [ ] Stripe webhook coverage handles disputes, connected-account status changes, and payout/transfer failures
- [x] Venue/artist verification enforced before an opportunity can be published or a settlement can run — `launch/tenant-verification`, shipped #772/#784/#792/#799/#825/#824
- [ ] Pre-launch dataset cleared / fresh seeded

### Compliance UI/UX
- [x] Browser storage inventory complete; unnecessary storage removed; necessary Auth/Stripe storage documented; any retained consent UI gates real optional technology (otherwise removed) — shipped in #482 (`storageManifest.ts` + `BROWSER_STORAGE.md`; sidebar cookie removed; Stripe/Maps load-on-use; banner retained and wired to gate via `consentGate.ts`)
- [ ] Privacy + T&Cs pages accessible from every footer
- [ ] Pricing transparency on all four payer journeys (gross, platform fee and total shown before commitment)
- [ ] Venue legal details on booking confirmation emails + invoices `launch/venue-legal-on-emails`
- [ ] Online Safety Act report-content button + email destination live `launch/osa-report-content` — **live:** in-app report button on inbound messages, structured safety-inbox email, persisted report record, reporter acknowledgement, admin hide/restore/resolve. **Outstanding:** the always-available published `report@`/`safety@` address on the footer legal pages, which depends on the solicitor-gated Privacy/T&Cs page routes above
- [x] Music licence attestation captured in Org setup form
- [ ] GDPR erasure + data export routes live, with the HMRC-retention split documented `launch/gdpr-subject-rights`
- [ ] Admin console reachable in production, with a real admin provisioning path (see "Build — MVP blockers")

### Operational
- [ ] support@ inbox monitored; SLA documented (target: first response within 1 working day)
- [ ] Status page live
- [ ] Database backups verified
- [x] Rate limiting active on auth, apply, messaging and upload endpoints
- [ ] Incident response process documented
- [ ] First 10 beta venues + 50 beta artists onboarded
- [ ] Marketing site live with pricing page

### Not required at launch
- Native mobile apps
- Multi-currency support
- Customer marketplace switch-on
- DAC7 export script *run* (first run isn't due until Jan 2028)
- Org-switcher / multi-org UX
- More granular membership roles
- B2B venue↔artist reviews / reputation
- Calendar sync (Google/Apple/Outlook)
- Financial/settlement CSV export
- Email notification preferences / unsubscribe (while all outbound mail stays transactional)
- Admin action audit log

## 8. Marketplace add-on (post-launch)

The marketplace is **deliberately additive** — designed so it can be switched on later without major refactor of the B2B code paths.

See [MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md](../marketplace/MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md) for the detail. Headline:
- Most of the marketplace infrastructure already exists (Customer SPA, Customer module, TicketEntity, ConcertEntity price/capacity fields).
- Switch-on is primarily UI work (pricing transparency, refund UI, consumer-facing emails) + consumer-protection legal (separate customer T&Cs from solicitor + CMA secondary-ticketing review).
- The B2B tenancy refactor doesn't change; settlement workflows don't change; Stripe Connect doesn't change.
- Estimated effort when the time comes: ~2-3 calendar months.

**Earliest realistic marketplace switch-on:** Q1 2027 (3 months after B2B launch). Push later if B2B traction needs all the focus.

## 8b. Repo topology — the cut is running, and it is not launch-gated

Owned by [`REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](../platform/REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md)
(§6 of [`POLYREPO_ROADMAP.md`](../platform/POLYREPO_ROADMAP.md)) — approved and in execution, stages 1–2
delivered. Nothing about it waits for launch.

**Tommy's ruling, 2026-08-27:** the monorepo has cost real development time — repeated setbacks, not a
theoretical tax — and cutting is the fix. That settles it against the two-condition trigger this section
used to carry (a codebase milestone AND a second engineer owning a service). That trigger is **deleted**,
not deferred: it argued the monorepo was strictly better for a single developer, and delivery has shown
otherwise. It also rested on facts that no longer hold — the six read-only mirror repos are gone, so a
"make the mirror writable" flip is not the mechanism; extraction is `git-filter-repo`, proven end to end
on Payment.

Sequencing lives in the plan's ledger, not here. The shape of it: the monorepo survives as the fallback
for local development and cross-service E2E until the final stage, so a service can be extracted before
its AppHost and E2E story is perfect.

## 9. Decision points still open

The DoorSplit/Versus revenue source and revenue model are now locked in the decision log below. The
settlement-dispute question below is a **product + legal** decision on the critical path; the two after
it are operational choices that are not urgent yet.

- **Venue↔artist settlement disputes** — an artist says they played, the venue says they no-showed; on
  DoorSplit/Versus the venue self-reports the door take and the artist has no way to contest the number.
  Escrow only releases or refunds — there is **no contested path**, and this sits directly on the
  differentiating contract types. Needs both a product decision (do we mediate, or is it strictly
  between the parties with Concertable as disclosed agent?) and a solicitor-drafted dispute/mediation
  clause; raise it alongside the illegal-content enforcement clause in §5. Decide by Month 5.
- **Beta cohort sourcing** — warm intros via existing music industry contacts? Cold outreach? Industry events? Decide by Month 4.
- **Support tooling** — shared inbox (Front, Helpscout) or just Gmail? Discord/Slack/WhatsApp for beta? Decide by Month 5.

## Decisions locked

The settled calls that constrain the work above. Full rationale + dated history are in git
(`git log -p plans/launch/LAUNCH_ROADMAP.md`) — not duplicated here.

- **B2B-first.** The customer ticket marketplace is deferred and additive (§8), not a v1 dependency.
- **All four contract types ship in v1.** DoorSplit/Versus settle via **manual door-take entry +
  charge-the-venue** — external-ticketer import ruled out; own checkout is the deferred durable feed. §9
- **Revenue model: one percentage of final deal gross.** B2B owns four deal-specific gross
  calculations; Payment owns the universal rate, binds it when the payer commits, charges commission
  on top of gross and records the retained amount in the ledger. No fixed/minimum/cap model remains
  after the launch cut-over. [PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md](PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PLAN.md)
- **Monetization principle:** the fee always rides the settlement transaction routed through our
  Stripe Connect — never invoice-only (else there's no transaction to take a cut from). §9
- **Backend domain type is `Tenant`** (Guid PK, request-scoped filtering, compliance value object);
  **"Organization" is the user-facing UI/API label only.** Multi-user membership/roles/auth-sweep
  are the outstanding Swim-lane B work — see [USER_MODEL_PLAN.md](../b2b/USER_MODEL_PLAN.md).
