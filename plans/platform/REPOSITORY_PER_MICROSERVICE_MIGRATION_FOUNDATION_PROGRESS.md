# Repository-per-microservice foundation progress

- Plan: `plans/platform/REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
- Roadmap: `plans/platform/POLYREPO_ROADMAP.md`
- Roadmap item: `platform/polyrepo-cut`
- Worktree: `C:\Users\TommySeery\source\repos\Concertable\.worktrees\Refactor-M1-Owner-Hosting-Sync`
- Branch: `Refactor/M1-Owner-Hosting-Sync`
- PR: #943, M1 P2 Owner Hosting Sync, restacked on the post-platform-sync main
- Dependency/package gates: PR #942 landed at `8899eae33` after exact merge-group run `34195643637` passed
  84 jobs with both browser suites green. Its causal package run `34198511871` computed version
  `0.1.0-alpha.0.1329`, but a prior non-main manual run had already published that version from #633's head;
  duplicate skipping therefore left the feed's AppHost.Shared and Frontend.Hosting binaries stale. The
  publication rail now forbids arbitrary-ref dispatch, checks every packed package for an existing or
  non-advancing SemVer before push, and restores the exact version it just published. Its own main merge
  triggers the required fresh release.
  AppHost Sync and Platform Contract remain gated on publishing the Owner Hosting
  Auth image, pinning its immutable digest, and qualifying all four standalone Auth client rosters. Package
  inventory and ACL checks require a credential with `read:packages`; private-repository merge-queue rulesets
  remain unavailable on the current GitHub entitlement.
- Last reconciled: 2026-09-08 — current `origin/main` commit
  `21760e777ecc6df0680bd846e8f814f035627ac4`, the platform-sync PR #954 merge, which includes PR #633, B2B
  producer PR #949, M3 PR #948, Platform Expand PR #942, publication-rail repair PR #953, the corrective
  topology commits `82bf5dbbb` and `bb59d9ba3`, and the fixed M1 repository topology.

## Current state

Checkpoint 6A is terminal: `.github` PRs #1 and #2 merged, all eleven reusable workflows passed from the
public fixture, and shared policy was applied and read back. Checkpoint 6B M1 is active. Platform Expand is landed and
its corrected package publication is complete: run `34203007892` published all 58 packages at
`0.1.0-alpha.0.1330` and platform-sync PR #954 landed those pins at `21760e777`. Owner Hosting Sync is
restacked on that exact main and is the active delivery stage.
Existing private
`auth`, `b2b`, `customer`, `payment`, `search`, `infra`, and `config` repositories retain their identities.
The remaining repository boundaries are `platform-dotnet`, `platform-frontend`, and `system`; no repository
creation is part of M1. Platform Expand is landed; three clean dependent branches preserve the Owner Hosting
Sync, AppHost Sync, and Platform Contract boundaries at heads `cbca8d48f`, `6895b13cb`, and `64f0c4dc1`
above it. Local
review remediation preserves the legacy Auth and B2B hosting contracts through the consumer-migration stage,
retires them only in Platform Contract, keeps the platform SPA surface product-neutral, and moves Auth client
associations into the B2B and Customer owners before system composition consumes their combined roster.
Platform Expand owns the merge-group repairs: it accepts Stripe's authoritative `requires_capture` state
when optional `capture_before` metadata is absent; makes cancellation scenarios wait for Payment refund
completion, Concert cancellation, and Payment outbox quiescence before reset; gives substituted
E2E projects distinct environment callback annotations; and defines the discriminator for every concrete
`ConfirmedBookingTerms` wire shape. It also removes Auth's production credential request budget from the
shared E2E environment so per-scenario login resets cannot leak limiter state between otherwise isolated
Customer and B2B scenarios. B2B declares its staged-and-consumed `BookingConfirmedEvent` in both runtime and
AppHost topology.

## Next Steps

- Deliver Owner Hosting Sync through PR #943 from its restacked head. Its eight staged commits are preserved
  above `21760e777` and carry one added commit that advances the Payment consumer pin to the published
  `0.1.0-alpha.0.1330` escrow contract, because main's image rail cannot compile B2B without it.
- Take the PR out of draft, own its CI and merge-queue gates to terminal, and follow its Auth image
  publication to the immutable digest.
- Require `Publish images` green on the resulting main before P3: it has failed on main since `516f4cc25`
  for B2B.Web and B2B.Workers, so that rail is the gate the added pin commit exists to clear.
- Pin and qualify that Auth image on AppHost Sync, then deliver AppHost Sync and Platform Contract in order.

## Completed work

- Checkpoint 6A closed through `.github` PR #1 (`ab2a127cdba9bacd73411fba8cca2b6a20fc02c0`) and policy repair
  PR #2 (`a2f574a1f4fad3df5e3ec8aa0dd552d717c95728`); fixture acceptance run 33894314188 passed.
- Corrective commits `82bf5dbbb` and `bb59d9ba3` established that the seven active carve repositories retain
  their identities; M1 fixes the remaining topology as `platform-dotnet`, `platform-frontend`, and `system`.
- Extraction-map preflight reports 4,793 tracked paths, 4,793 target claims, 82 unclaimed tracked paths, and
  zero multiply-claimed paths; 6C is not ready.
- Platform Expand landed through PR #942 at `8899eae33`. The shared inventory and plan reconciliation
  preserved M3's landed `app/build-config` ownership and `platform-frontend` identity while retaining M1 as
  the active foundation ledger.
- M3 landed through PR #948 at `12efedd68`; its product-neutral `@concertable/build-config` ownership remains
  independent of M1's .NET hosting stack and no repository boundary changed.
- Platform frontend service URL propagation now resolves both HTTPS and HTTP Aspire endpoints and both hyphenated
  and normalized resource names, so the B2B mobile API tunnel is emitted correctly.
- Review remediation added exact Auth SPA replacement and unknown-client fail-closed coverage, retained legacy
  hosting compatibility until the final contract stage, made resolver assertions portable across Windows and
  Linux, completed the exact platform extraction table, added owner Auth-roster assertions to the B2B,
  Customer, and system graphs, and added deterministic coverage that exercises every owner frontend path through
  the production B2B and Customer hosting extensions in both extracted-only and monorepo-preferred layouts.

## Verification

- Platform Expand is exact on landed `origin/main` commit `8899eae33`; the three dependent stages retain
  their verified serial ancestry and await the corrected package release/platform-sync base.
- Pre-M3 exact-head PR run `34166392329` passed all 81 executed jobs, including package preparation, generated
  inventory, solution/image builds, five service carves, architecture, unit, and integration matrices.
- Package inventory and local platform preparation pass with 58 packages. Auth Hosting, B2B Hosting, Auth
  AppHost, and B2B AppHost build successfully against the locally prepared platform packages; the compatibility
  form of Auth Hosting and B2B Hosting also builds at the AppHost Sync boundary.
- `Concertable.AppHost.Shared` passes 16/16 tests. Auth architecture passes 9/9 tests. B2B package-mode
  architecture passes 35/35 against the current Payment.Hosting producer placed at #633's pinned package slot;
  Search architecture passes 4/4 and Payment architecture passes 13/13. B2B and Customer Hosting also build
  independently against the locally prepared platform packages. Customer's current Hosting and architecture-test
  assemblies compile in isolation and the two extracted/monorepo frontend-layout cases pass 2/2.
- The post-repair package-clean gates pass `Concertable.AppHost.Shared` 18/18,
  `Concertable.Payment.E2ETests.Server` 7/7, and B2B architecture 32/32. The B2B UI project is rebuilt
  package-clean before publication; the exact browser scenario remains a remote gate because this
  workstation's Docker endpoint is unavailable.
- The former #633 Customer compile blocker and Payment.Hosting package slot are now eligible for exact landed-base
  revalidation; their previous blocked result is not carried forward as current evidence.
- The targeted local 3DS UI E2E suite passes 8/8. This includes the formerly failing venue-manager flat-fee
  successful-challenge scenario. Its deterministic cause was a missing `ApplicationAcceptedEvent` B2B
  subscription in `B2BTopology`; the repair provisions the exact
  `concertable-b2b-application-accepted` subscription and locks it down with composition coverage. The
  scenario URL wait is 30 seconds so a genuine failure terminates sooner. Remote merge-group E2E remains the
  authoritative delivery gate.
- Platform Expand merge-group commit `f0ad78ad1` proved the B2B UI suite green at 32/32, including every 3DS
  path. Customer UI passed 6/7; the sole failure trace showed the card-number input remained exactly empty
  because the generic successful-test-card step selected the saved-card path even though the isolated Stripe
  fixture creates fresh customers without attached cards. Platform Expand now routes that step through the
  explicit successful new-card path; the same merge-group artifact already proves that path completes Stripe
  confirmation, ticket creation, ticket listing, and QR display. A local post-fix run authorised all three
  card payments but its downstream confirmation assertions encountered workstation Service Bus and SQL health
  degradation, so the exact-head merge-group Customer run remains the acceptance evidence for this repair.
- The subsequent exact merge-group run `34174839388` at `be47d6beec91744955930e5fd75b61c5770e6281`
  passed 31/32 B2B UI scenarios. Its sole failure completed Stripe's 3DS challenge and returned 204 from B2B
  acceptance, then Payment rejected the `requires_capture` observation and exhausted all three deliveries of
  `concertable.payment.capture-escrow.v1` as `PaymentProviderUnavailableException`; no capture event or concert
  draft could follow. The owning repair accepts an authorized observation without optional `capture_before`,
  normalizes Stripe.NET's missing-timestamp Unix-epoch sentinel back to absence, and retains fail-closed expiry
  evaluation when no provider deadline exists. Payment unit tests pass 552/552, including the exact
  `RequiresAction` to `Authorized` regression and adapter normalization. The focused resolver integration test
  compiles locally; its execution awaits CI because this workstation's Docker endpoint is unavailable.
- Exact-head run `34178610726` at `2373f68545919353a364aa2f8e75bc89c483a073` passed all 87 jobs. Its
  merge-group successor `34179430318` passed 31/32 B2B UI scenarios; the final scenario did
  not start because its `BeforeScenario` Payment reset received HTTP 500. Diagnostics identify SQL deadlock
  victim 1205 in Respawn while Payment's outbox dispatcher was completing the preceding refund, plus repeated
  B2B `BookingConfirmedEvent` registry failures. The repair verifies the Stripe refund, Concert cancellation,
  and zero active Payment outbox rows before returning from the cancellation step, and adds the missing B2B
  publish/subscribe registration with composition coverage.
- Exact-head run `34183872683` passed at `417e8b04f42883797c9de2d48460f3dbe7e7b45a`; pull-request policy
  skipped both E2E jobs. Exact-tree merge-group run `34184548934` passed every non-browser gate, then B2B UI
  passed 25/32. Six checkout scenarios received HTTP 500 for every Stripe webhook because the substituted
  Payment project shared its environment annotation object with the explicit-start image and did not receive
  `Stripe__WebhookSecret`. The same diagnostics independently exposed poisoned B2B
  `BookingConfirmedEvent` outbox dispatches caused by deserializing abstract `ConfirmedBookingTerms`; they do
  not cause the seventh scenario: that scenario completed its Stripe refund and Concert cancellation before
  timing out on an invalid `BookingState.Cancelled` assertion. The UI invokes Concert cancellation, while a
  confirmed Booking intentionally does not enter the Booking cancellation state machine; the repair removes
  that invalid poll while retaining refund, Concert cancellation, and Payment outbox quiescence gates.
  Environment callbacks are now cloned per substituted resource, and explicit `$type` mappings cover FlatFee,
  VenueHire, DoorSplit, and Versus terms. The focused callback tests pass 7/7, Booking unit tests pass 13/13
  including four nested abstract-contract round trips, and the B2B UI project builds successfully.
- Exact-head run `34189563168` passed all required executable gates at `e2af6b9ce`. Its exact-tree merge-group
  run `34190370396` passed every non-browser job, the API E2E suite, all 32 B2B UI scenarios, and six of seven
  Customer UI scenarios. The final Customer signup login was rejected with HTTP 429 and `Retry-After: 60`:
  scenario hooks deliberately reset login capture before every scenario, but Auth's in-memory IP limiter
  survives those database resets and accumulated more than ten credential-page requests in one minute. The
  shared E2E Auth environment now sets the credential permit limit through Auth's supported configuration
  seam, matching integration-test isolation without changing the production default or any browser timeout.
- Exact merge-group run `34195643637` passed 84 jobs at merge SHA `8899eae33`, including API E2E and both
  complete browser suites, and PR #942 landed. Causal package run `34198511871` packed 58 projects at
  `0.1.0-alpha.0.1329`, but skipped 57 immutable duplicates because workflow-dispatch run `33683064354` had
  pre-published that version from non-main #633 head `83c01d3b`; only the newly packable
  B2B.Application.Contracts was added. The former floating restore passed against that mixed feed version,
  proving it was not an adequate publication gate. The repair makes main-push ancestry exclusive, requires
  every packed package's computed lockstep version to be absent and advance beyond its own feed history before
  any push, removes duplicate skipping, applies NuGet SemVer precedence, and verifies that exact version.

## Reviews

The local work order is `reviews/Refactor-M1-Platform-Contract.md`. Its last immutable full pass requested one
delivery-gated change: publish and pin the Owner Hosting Auth image before AppHost Sync. All other findings are
repaired on their owning stages. The landed-base candidate requires a new frozen review watermark after current
package and composition validation completes.

## Decisions, discoveries, blockers, and deviations

- The cross-service Payment package pin drifted behind a contract it already consumed. `538bbc568` added
  `IEscrowOperationsClient.AuthorizeAsync` to Payment's client and switched B2B's checkout service onto it in
  one commit, but B2B and Customer pin Payment through `ConcertablePaymentVersion`, which stayed at
  `0.1.0-alpha.0.1322`. The CI compile floor builds Payment from source through `local-platform.ps1`, so only
  image publication exercised the real feed pin and it failed there with CS1061. `platform-sync.yml` bumps
  only `ConcertablePlatformVersion`, leaving this pin hand-maintained; the same drift will recur until a gate
  builds a consumer's deployable closure against the published Payment version.
- Existing service, `infra`, and `config` repository IDs and active owner ledgers override historical labels;
  they are not renamed or replaced.
- Shared packages have two repository owners: `platform-dotnet` and `platform-frontend`. The frontend owner
  contains general shared web/mobile code; web and mobile remain package tiers, not repositories.
- `system` is a separate container-composition and black-box qualification boundary.
- M1 creates no repositories and makes no further topology decision.
- The current GitHub entitlement returns 403 for private-repository ruleset, merge-queue, and branch-protection
  reads. There is no technical private-main enforcement substitute on this entitlement: targets remain private
  and non-canonical behind an administrator-operated CI/PR gate until an entitlement upgrade is verified.
