# Polyrepo Roadmap — services as genuinely standalone repos

> **Roadmap** for the polyrepo epic — the living progress tracker, not a plan (no `_PROGRESS.md`, never
> deleted, lives until the epic ships). Each buildable item spins off its own feature plan; the
> roadmap tier is the `plans` skill.
>
> **North star:** [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) — *"The monorepo is a convenience only — the
> backend services are independently-owned microservices and are designed to split into separate repos."*
> Design every change as if that split already happened: would this still work if this service lived alone?
> This roadmap tracks the work that makes that literally true.
>
> **Definition of done for the epic:** each service (`B2B`, `Customer`, `Auth`, `Payment`, `Search`), both
> platform repositories (`platform-dotnet`, `platform-frontend`), and `system` build, test, **document, and plan**
> themselves standing alone; every cross-service dependency
> is Contracts/published-package only; and the cut (§6) has run, so each service folder **is** its own
> coherent, self-describing repo.
>
> **Scope note:** this tracks only the polyrepo/services-as-repos streams. Other `plans/platform/` plans
> (deployment, DNS, pipeline redesign, E2E strategy) are separate concerns and are **not** tracked here.
>
> **The cut itself — "repository per microservice" — is §6, and its plan is
> [`REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md), with its
> exclusive active-stream ledgers listed in §6.** It is named for the target shape rather than for this epic,
> so a search for "polyrepo" does not find it — start at §6.
>
> **Companion / standing docs:**
> [`../../api/docs/MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../api/docs/MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Status — what's shipped vs. what's left

**Shipped — verified, don't rebuild:** in-monolith decomposition (god-`ConcertEntity` split, `Shared.*`
collapsed to Kernel+Contracts, User TPH dismantled, Auth identity-only) · first cross-process extraction
(Customer on its own host + DB) · the **backend carve** (feed `PackageReference`s, per-folder CPM,
`EnforceServiceBoundary`, `carve-*` CI, `platform-sync`) · the extraction mechanism, proven end to end on
Payment with `git-filter-repo` (802 commits, whole `src/` runtime compiled clean off the feed).

**In flight:** the **cut** (§6) — checkpoints 1–2, the final Hosting RT3, checkpoint 4, and checkpoint 6A delivered;
extraction unblocked — and the **frontend full-stack carve** (`POLYREPO_FULLSTACK_PLAN`, Phase 3 left).

**Partly shipped:** per-service **doc & guidance locality** (§4) — the ownership rule + per-service
`AGENTS.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md` gaps landed (PR #383); only **4c** (plans-tree relocation, gated on §6) remains.

**Retired:** mirroring (§5) — the six mirror repos, both workflows and the runbook are deleted.

---

## 1. Backend decomposition & extraction — 🟠 mostly done

Owned by [`MICROSERVICE_STEPS_PLAN.md`](MICROSERVICE_STEPS_PLAN.md) (+
[`MICROSERVICE_STEPS_CONT_PLAN.md`](MICROSERVICE_STEPS_CONT_PLAN.md)) and the leftover-coupling list in
[`TECHNICAL_DEBT.md`](TECHNICAL_DEBT.md).

- [x] ✅ **Phase 1 — in-monolith decomposition.** `ConcertEntity` split, `Concertable.Shared.*` → Kernel +
  Contracts, `SharedDbContext`/Genre relocated, User TPH dismantled, Auth identity-only, Search upstream
  refs cleaned.
- [x] ✅ **Phase 2 — first extraction (Customer).** Customer API + Workers on their own host + DB; bus,
  outbox/inbox introduced.
- [x] ✅ **Phase 3–4.** (Steps 12–16 per the plan's status header.)
- [ ] 🟠 **Phase 5 — event schema versioning** (Step 17). Outstanding.
- [ ] 🟠 **IVT / legacy-coupling retirement** — `A1`–`A7` in [`TECHNICAL_DEBT.md`](TECHNICAL_DEBT.md):
  internal-visibility grants and legacy-host consumption of module internals, retired as the owning steps
  land.

## 2. Backend carve — ✅ done

Cross-service deps go through published `Concertable.*` packages, not project references: feed
`PackageReference`s, per-folder Central Package Management, the `EnforceServiceBoundary` guard, `carve-*`
CI jobs, and `platform-sync` (MinVer bump + `<ConcertablePlatformVersion>` sync PR on every `api/**`
merge). This is the backend half of "builds alone from a feed." Documented in
[`../../api/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../api/ARCHITECTURE.md) ("Cross-service contract distribution" /
"Per-folder build closures").

## 3. Frontend full-stack carve — 🟡 in progress

Owned by [`POLYREPO_FULLSTACK_PLAN.md`](POLYREPO_FULLSTACK_PLAN.md) /
[`POLYREPO_FULLSTACK_PROGRESS.md`](POLYREPO_FULLSTACK_PROGRESS.md). Makes `customer` and `b2b` genuine
full-stack units (their `api/` service **plus** web + mobile), each restoring shared FE code from a package
feed — the npm analogue of the backend carve.

- [x] ✅ **Phase 0** — scoped npm registry + PAT.
- [x] ✅ **Phase 1** — publish the universal core `@concertable/shared` (published, restorable).
- [x] ✅ **Phase 2** — package the four remaining tiers + cut consumers over (done on branch, PR pending).
- [ ] 🟡 **Phase 3** `platform/polyrepo-fullstack` — prove each surface feed-restores its shared deps, `carve-fe-{customer,b2b}` CI, FE
  import-boundary rule, and close the Phase-2 metro/nativewind/tailwind + carve-CSS runtime deferrals.

- [ ] **B2B package topology** `platform/b2b-package-topology` - separate the manager-web tier as
  `@concertable/web-b2b`, retain `@concertable/b2b` as the cross-platform B2B core, and migrate web
  and mobile consumers through [`B2B_PACKAGE_TOPOLOGY_PLAN.md`](B2B_PACKAGE_TOPOLOGY_PLAN.md).

## 4. Per-service doc & guidance locality — 🟠 4a + 4b shipped; 4c deferred

**The stream this roadmap was created to drive.** Guidance was only partly co-located with the service that
owns it, so a mirror of a service folder was *not* a self-describing repo and an agent working one service
loaded root-level noise instead of that service's own rules. **4a + 4b shipped in PR #383** (ownership rule
+ per-service `AGENTS.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md` gaps); their plan (`SERVICE_DOC_LOCALITY_*`) is deleted, git
history is the archive. **4c** (relocating the cross-cutting `plans/` tree) remains — gated on the §6
end-state decision.

**Ownership rule to establish first (the design decision):** *each artifact lives at the lowest node that
fully contains its concern.* Single-service → the service folder (and it rides the mirror when run);
multi-service or monorepo-orchestration → root. This is the rule that decides every move below and must be
written into [`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) + [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) before any files move.
The existing `Concertable.Payment` thin `CLAUDE.md → @AGENTS.md` pair (service-specific rules only,
inheriting root + `api/` upward) is the template.

Gap map (verified 2026-08-05):

| Artifact | State | Outstanding |
|---|---|---|
| `TECH_DEBT.md` | ✅ per-service | — |
| `README.md` | ✅ per-service | — |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | ✅ B2B, Customer, Auth, AppHost, **Payment, Search** | Messaging skipped (shared library, not a data/adapter service) |
| service-root `AGENTS.md` | ✅ Payment, **B2B, Customer, Auth** | Search + Messaging skipped (nothing beyond upward guidance) |
| `plans/` | 🔴 centralized by *initiative* | see the seam decision below |

- [x] ✅ **4a — Ownership rule.** "Lowest fully-containing node" written into root + `api/` `AGENTS.md`, single-sourced; `Concertable.Payment` named as the thin-file template.
- [x] ✅ **4b — Fill the cheap gaps.** Thin `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` for B2B, Customer, Auth; `ARCHITECTURE.md` for Payment + Search. Search + Messaging `AGENTS.md` and Messaging `ARCHITECTURE.md` skipped (lazy creation — nothing service-specific).
- [ ] 🔴 **4c — Plans locality (the contentious part).** `plans/` is organized by *initiative*, and many initiatives (`launch`, `typed-result`, `marketplace`) span every service and **cannot** live in one service folder. So this is not "push everything down": a single-service plan moves into its service; a cross-service/orchestration plan stays at root. Settle this seam **with §6** before moving live plans, and never relocate an in-flight plan with a live worktree/ledger (e.g. `POLYREPO_FULLSTACK`) mid-flight.

**Sequencing:** 4a + 4b are done (PR #383); 4c holds until the end-state seam (§6) is decided.

## 5. Mirror automation — ✅ retired 2026-08-27

**The stream is closed by deletion, not by delivery.** §6 chose a true one-way cut, which makes read-only
mirrors a dead end. The six mirror repos no longer exist on GitHub (verified twice on 2026-08-27:
`gh repo list Concertable` returns only `agent-standards`, `concertable`, `docs`, `config`, `infra`), so
`mirror.yml` and `mirror-parity.yml` were force-pushing to deleted repositories. Stage 2 round-trip 3 of the
§6 plan deleted both workflows and the `POLYREPO.md` runbook. Neither workflow was a required status check.
The bootstrap role mirrors once had is superseded: the §6 plan extracts with `git-filter-repo`, proven end
to end on Payment.

## 6. End-state shape — ✅ decided 2026-08-18: a true one-way cut

**Tommy's ruling: the monorepo goes.** Services become independently-developed repos, not buildable
read-only mirrors. This unblocks §4c and settles the guidance question that was blocked behind it: there
is no `api/` node in a polyrepo, so `api/agents/` and `api/AGENTS.md` are destinations with no future.
Everything in them re-homes to `standards/` (platform-wide, inherited by every service repo) or to the
owning service's repo. **Done 2026-08-19:** `api/agents/` and `app/agents/` are deleted, the generic half
lives in `tomjseery/dotagents` and `tomjseery/react-agents` and this system's roster in
`Concertable/agent-standards`, all delivered as plugins; `api/AGENTS.md` is 78 lines of pointers with no
`@`-imports. `docs/INDEX.md` maps topic to owner.

- [ ] 🟡 **The cut itself** `platform/polyrepo-cut` — owned by
  [`REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) /
  the active-stream records below. Git history retains the deleted umbrella ledger; it does not own
  execution.
  Approved and in execution 2026-08-26. Eleven repositories (five services, `platform-dotnet`,
  `platform-frontend`, `system`, `infra`, `config`, `.github`); seventeen checkpoints; the Payment extraction is
  proven end to end.
  **Checkpoints 1–2, the final Hosting RT3, checkpoint 4, and checkpoint 6A are delivered** (all 45 test-tier
  cross-repository `ProjectReference`s are now packages, standalone AppHosts consume published Hosting/image
  boundaries, and full-system E2E composition is system-owned). RT3 closed through
  [PR #897](https://github.com/Concertable/concertable/pull/897)
  (`2979ab78f4204eeed07cca06654777a37965f007`) and Stage 4 closed through
  [PR #912](https://github.com/Concertable/concertable/pull/912)
  (`62390281b4191a7166136d69163a2c6482f6a463`); Git history retains their deleted ledgers. The public
  organization workflow foundation closed through
  [`.github` PR #1](https://github.com/Concertable/.github/pull/1)
  (`ab2a127cdba9bacd73411fba8cca2b6a20fc02c0`) and its live-policy verification repair through
  [`.github` PR #2](https://github.com/Concertable/.github/pull/2)
  (`a2f574a1f4fad3df5e3ec8aa0dd552d717c95728`). All eleven reusable workflows passed from the exact-head
  public fixture in [run 33894314188](https://github.com/Concertable/workflow-fixture/actions/runs/33894314188);
  teams, owner access, release-environment policy, the main merge queue, and immutable-tag protection were
  then applied and read back successfully.
  Preparation and delivery have separate dependency graphs: private service-repository preparation runs in
  parallel, while publication, system consumption, source removal, deployment, and archive
  remain ordered and require explicit authorization.

  | Stream | State and exclusive owner | Durable record |
  |---|---|---|
  | Foundation 6B / M1-M4 | Active across isolated packet worktrees: M1 is the ordered four-stage hosting stack; M2 and M3 are independent siblings based on PR #633; M4 follows the M1 package/API shape. This stream owns live-target identity reconciliation, package-ACL preflight, extraction-map readiness, and the preparation packets. Existing carve repository IDs and active owner ledgers override historical labels. | [`REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_FOUNDATION_PROGRESS.md`](REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_FOUNDATION_PROGRESS.md) |
  | Customer | Active in the existing private `customer` checkout; package access and exact-head CI are green, and this stream owns only checkpoint-13 repository preparation. | [`REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_CUSTOMER_FRONTEND_PROGRESS.md`](REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_CUSTOMER_FRONTEND_PROGRESS.md) |
  | Auth | Paused but implementable in the existing private `auth` checkout; owns only checkpoint-10 repository preparation. | [`REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_AUTH_NEXT_PROGRESS.md`](REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_AUTH_NEXT_PROGRESS.md) |
  | Payment | Reserved exclusively to the Payment preparation stream in the existing private `payment` repository; no open PR exists. | [`REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_PAYMENT_PROMOTION_PROGRESS.md`](REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_PAYMENT_PROMOTION_PROGRESS.md) |
  | Search | Reserved exclusively to the Search preparation stream in the existing private `search` repository; no open PR exists. | [`REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_SEARCH_PROMOTION_PROGRESS.md`](REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_SEARCH_PROMOTION_PROGRESS.md) |

  Agents read this table and the named ledger before acting. One stream never edits a sibling ledger or
  worktree. B2B preparation remains unassigned until its existing
  `wip/b2b-frontend-fold-handoff` checkout is reconciled; the completed Stage 4 boundary leaves system
  extraction available for its later repository-foundation checkpoint.

  **Post-cut development-fixture terminology.** Keep the current `SeedCatalog`, `Seed.Contracts`,
  `SeedState`, and `Seed.Simulator` names stable while repository ownership and publication boundaries are
  moving. After the polyrepo cut is complete, run a dedicated cross-repository naming redesign around the
  `DevFixture` vocabulary. That follow-up may rename types, packages, and simulator images, but it must
  preserve the architecture: owners seed only canonical state, reaction-only projections are populated by
  production-shaped events, and standalone consumers use producer-owned lightweight event publishers rather
  than another data service's runtime. Decide the exact name mapping in that follow-up instead of spreading
  opportunistic renames across promotion PRs.

**The launch gate below is WITHDRAWN (2026-08-26.)** It is kept for the reasoning it records, but it
inverted the trade-off: the monorepo taxes every launch PR — full E2E, full checkout, full migration,
blast radius over untouched services — so the cut accelerates launch rather than delaying it. The
sequencing insight replacing it: the monorepo survives as the fallback for local development and
cross-service E2E until the final stage, so a service can be extracted before its AppHost and E2E
story is perfect.

**~~When the cut runs — gated on the launch plan.~~** Executing the cut — creating the service repos and
deleting the monorepo — does **not** begin until the entire launch plan
([`plans/launch/LAUNCH_ROADMAP.md`](../launch/LAUNCH_ROADMAP.md)) is delivered; that is months out. What ran
first was the polyrepo-*ready* corpus work (tracked by `docs/polyrepo-ready` in
[`../docs/DOCS_ROADMAP.md`](../docs/DOCS_ROADMAP.md), now **DONE** — plan and ledger deleted, git history the
archive): re-homing every rule out of the doomed nodes so the eventual repos inherit a correct corpus on day
one. `api/AGENTS.md` is one of those
nodes (its N3) and re-homes **well before** the cut — it is not itself launch-gated; only the physical
split is. N3 re-homes its content to `Concertable/agent-standards` (the shared-is-the-intersection rule into
`SERVICE_BOUNDARIES.md`; every other section was already skill-owned) and deletes `api/AGENTS.md` +
`api/CLAUDE.md`; the backend floor is thereafter the `.agents/skill-routes.json` routes over the `dotnet` plugin.

The repository topology is fixed: existing service, `infra`, and `config` identities remain; shared packages
split into `platform-dotnet` and `platform-frontend`; and `system` owns container composition plus black-box
qualification. General frontend sharing spans web and mobile, while web and mobile remain package tiers rather
than repositories. Extraction layout mechanics must preserve this topology and do not reopen it.

### Original framing (kept for the trade-off it records)

The open architecture decisions (D-A / D-B in [`POLYREPO_FULLSTACK_PLAN.md`](POLYREPO_FULLSTACK_PLAN.md)):

- **Buildable read-only mirrors** (monorepo stays source of truth, today's model) **vs. a true one-way
  cut** to independently-developed repos.
- If a true full-stack cut: **restructure to per-service colocation** (`services/<x>/{api,web,mobile}`) **vs.
  a multi-source mirror assembler** (`git subtree split` takes one prefix, so it can't fuse a service's
  api + web + mobile + shared as-is).

This gate governs how much to invest in §5, and whether §4c's plan-locality moves should also anticipate a
`services/<x>/` layout. **Resolve at the root architecture level, not inside a feature PR.**

---

## Decision log

- **2026-08-31 — Defer seed vocabulary redesign until after the cut.** The current behaviour remains
  load-bearing, but the `SeedCatalog`/`Seed.Contracts`/`SeedState`/`Seed.Simulator` terminology will be
  redesigned around `DevFixture` once all repository and publication boundaries are stable. Promotion
  streams must not mix that naming migration into the polyrepo cut.
- **2026-08-05 — Roadmap created.** The polyrepo epic existed as a roadmap-less cluster
  (`MICROSERVICE_STEPS`, backend carve, `POLYREPO_FULLSTACK`, deferred mirroring); this roadmap unifies it
  and adds per-service doc & guidance locality (§4) as a tracked stream. Anchor for the doc-locality work
  Tommy raised.
- **2026-08-05 — §4 4a + 4b shipped (PR #383).** Ownership rule ("lowest fully-containing node") written
  into root + `api/` `AGENTS.md`; thin service-root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` added for B2B, Customer, Auth
  and `ARCHITECTURE.md` for Payment + Search (Search + Messaging `AGENTS.md` and Messaging `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  skipped — nothing service-specific). Docs-reviewed (3 accuracy findings fixed). Owning plan
  `SERVICE_DOC_LOCALITY_*` deleted; git history is the archive. **4c** (plans-tree relocation) remains, gated on §6.
- **2026-08-20 — Cut execution gated on launch.** The one-way cut (repo creation + monorepo deletion) waits
  for the entire launch plan to ship. The polyrepo-ready corpus re-home (incl. `api/AGENTS.md` N3) was the
  prerequisite that ran first and is not launch-gated.
- **2026-08-24 — polyrepo-ready corpus re-home DONE.** All nodes shipped and N8 proved a carved service stands
  alone; its plan/ledger are deleted (tracked done as `docs/polyrepo-ready`). The only residual is §4c
  plans-locality — relocating the plan *documents* — which is cut-time work owned here, still gated on the §6
  colocation sub-decision below.
- **2026-08-27 — §6 stages 1–2 delivered; §5 retired.** The test-tier package boundary is complete: 45 → 0
  cross-repository `ProjectReference`s in the test tier, `*.Hosting` published and consumed from the feed,
  both the in-monorepo swap-back and the carved feed-restore proven on the same commit. §5 closed by
  deletion — the six mirrors no longer exist, so `mirror.yml`, `mirror-parity.yml` and `POLYREPO.md` are
  gone. Extraction is unblocked: `blockingRuntimeEdges` is 1 repo-wide and all five carve gates are green.
- **2026-08-27 — the launch-gate trigger is deleted, not archived.** `LAUNCH_ROADMAP` §8b carried a
  two-condition trigger (a codebase milestone AND a second engineer owning a service) whose core claim was
  that with one developer the monorepo is *strictly better*. Tommy's ruling: the monorepo has cost real
  development time — repeated setbacks, not a theoretical tax — so that claim is refuted by delivery and
  the trigger is removed rather than kept for reference. It also rested on dead facts: the mirrors are gone,
  so "make the mirror writable" is not the mechanism. §8b is now a pointer to §6 and this ruling.
