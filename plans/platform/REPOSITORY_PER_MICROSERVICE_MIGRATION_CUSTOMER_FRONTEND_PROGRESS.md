# Repository-per-microservice migration — Customer progress

- Plan: `plans/platform/REPOSITORY_PER_MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
- Roadmap: `plans/platform/POLYREPO_ROADMAP.md`
- Roadmap item: `platform/polyrepo-cut`
- Worktree: `C:\Users\tommy\source\repos\customer`
- Branch: `Chore/customer-promotion-preparation`
- PR: draft [`Concertable/customer#1`](https://github.com/Concertable/customer/pull/1), exact head
  `79cb07d6dab684a75cba60012374ac76c41c4b0c`
- Dependency/package gates: the canonical solution's package closure, artifact retention, TestKit,
  CODEOWNERS, immutable action refs, and repository SHA enforcement are green. The separately retained
  ArchitectureTests project cannot restore `Concertable.Testing.Architecture` under Customer's package ACL
  and remains outside the canonical solution as before; final publication and delivery remain unauthorized
- Last reconciled: **2026-09-02** from reviewed Customer head
  `79cb07d6dab684a75cba60012374ac76c41c4b0c`, successful CI run `33636812070`, and the canonical
  standalone-solution audit

## Current state

State: **repository preparation active; inert promotion preflight green**. GitHub repository `Concertable/customer-next`
was renamed in place to canonical `Concertable/customer`; repository ID `1351337130`, PR #1, branches, and
history were preserved. The inactive local checkout moved from `customer-next` to `customer`, and its origin
now uses `https://github.com/Concertable/customer.git`.

The extraction proof at `e21ae9079ca2fdd3a0063a252f05499159d608ff` contains the Customer backend,
web, mobile, customer-only shared package, and standalone support closure. Draft PR #1 validates the owned
build, tests, migration snapshots, package candidates, and Customer Web, migrations, and seed-simulator OCI
candidates. Package-level Actions read access is granted for the exact closure recorded below, except the
separately retained ArchitectureTests dependency. No package or image was published or pushed.

At exact head `c83169dd2a3d172d765425b12e032e704fcdc4fa`, Customer gained a machine-readable
promotion manifest for exactly four NuGet and three OCI candidates. CI validates actual NuGet metadata and
each Docker archive's embedded repository, selected SHA tag, and config-digest shape. Manual dispatch remains
read-only and requires an existing annotated v-prefixed tag that resolves to the exact selected commit; its
NuGet versions and OCI tags must match that release tag. The workflow contains no package/image publish or
push operation and has only `contents: read` and `packages: read` permissions.

At exact head `08ddbd812fd037544be47da2530098c49b278e86`, the manifest and every package and
integrity gate now cover five NuGet candidates, adding the black-box `Concertable.Customer.TestKit`.
The package exposes an injected-`HttpClient` client and Customer-owned ticket purchase/upcoming-ticket wire
models only; it has no runtime implementation, DbContext, entity, Hosting, or foreign-service reference.
Its focused contract tests, clean-consumer closure, and the complete Customer CI gate are green without any
package or image publication.

At exact head `a12ab4574858743ddc30432cc0bedf567a8303c2`, all hand-written Customer runtime,
design-time, and integration-fixture connection-name lookups use the service-local `Db.Name` constant. The
AppHost-facing `CustomerConstants.Database` remains the composition-side alias. All seven modules already
use their local `Schema.Name` and `Schema.Tables.*` constants for hand-written EF mappings; generated
migrations and snapshots remain unchanged.

At exact head `79cb07d6dab684a75cba60012374ac76c41c4b0c`, `Concertable.Customer.slnx` is the sole
canonical solution and the carve-era duplicate is removed. The broken monorepo-only `UseLocalCore` swap is
gone. CI restores, builds, tests, and packs the canonical solution with checkout credentials disabled after
fetch. `Concertable.Customer.TestKit` now packages its README, and the clean-consumer gate compiles concrete
uses of every Customer package. Standalone guidance now names this repository as canonical, uses the real
solution and .NET 10, and no longer claims the absent standalone AppHost or broken parent guidance paths.

Customer PR #1 carries repository-wide bootstrap ownership for `@tomjseery` and immutable SHAs for all five
action invocations. Exact-head CI run [`33636812070`](https://github.com/Concertable/customer/actions/runs/33636812070)
is green, and the repository Actions policy reads back `sha_pinning_required: true` while preserving
`allowed_actions: all`, default read-only workflow permissions, and disabled PR approvals.

No agent following this ledger may monitor or edit RT3, Stage 4 fleet E2E, Auth, Payment, Search, or another
stream's ledger. This file is the exclusive durable record for Customer; the temporary Customer promotion
ledger was retired after its live evidence was consolidated here.

## Next Steps

Blocked: Customer Actions receives a package-specific `403` for `Concertable.Testing.Architecture`, keeping `Concertable.Customer.ArchitectureTests` outside the canonical Customer solution.
Blocked by: the `Concertable.Testing.Architecture` platform package owner.
Unblock action: grant `Concertable/customer` Actions read access to the `Concertable.Testing.Architecture` package.
Resume when: restore `Concertable.Customer.ArchitectureTests` to `Concertable.Customer.slnx` and require exact-head Customer CI to pass.

## Completed work

- Customer backend, web, mobile, and `@concertable/customer` histories were folded into the private
  repository; local Customer workspaces use `file:` linkage and external
  `@concertable/{shared,web,mobile}` dependencies use the published `alpha` channel.
- `9e23956` prevents Vitest's `serve`/`test` configuration load from invoking the trusted development-certificate
  requirement while preserving HTTPS for the real Vite development server.
- `2ecc33c` adds serialized backend tests, validates the current three-package candidate set from an isolated
  consumer, and builds a Customer Web OCI archive candidate without publishing packages or images.
- `97aec2b` adds the dedicated `customer-migrations` job/image candidate, isolates migration-only service
  registration from runtime startup, and keeps the runtime fallback until AppHost orchestration invokes the
  migration resource.
- `1b6e49f` adds the downward-only `Concertable.Customer.Seed.Contracts` package and deterministic Customer
  seed simulator, drives Customer seed state and the simulator from one review spec, and adds parity,
  idempotency, clean-consumer, and real OCI load/run gates without publishing artifacts.
- `5555ac8` adds deterministic integrity evidence for the exact four NuGet and three OCI candidates: one
  `SHA256SUMS`, seven CycloneDX SBOMs, and pinned vulnerability and secret scans, without publication.
- `4d1a1ef` adds the exact promotion manifest, repository metadata validator, and manual annotated-tag gate;
  `c83169d` binds every built OCI archive to its configured repository and selected SHA/release tag. The
  promotion path remains a read-only preflight with no publication command or permission.
- `0702477` adds repository-wide bootstrap `CODEOWNERS` for `@tomjseery` and pins every Customer CI action to the verified immutable commit behind its recorded `v4` channel.
- `01bc246` adds the black-box `Concertable.Customer.TestKit`, focused HTTP contract tests, and the fifth
  NuGet promotion candidate; `08ddbd8` aligns the integrity-evidence gate with eight package/image SBOMs and
  six Trivy reports.
- `a12ab45` centralizes the Customer database connection name behind service-local `Db.Name` across runtime,
  design-time, and integration-fixture registration while preserving the AppHost composition alias.
- `6271c23` makes `Concertable.Customer.slnx` canonical, removes carve/`UseLocalCore` residue, packages the
  TestKit README, compiles package usage in the consumer preflight, hardens checkout credential handling,
  and corrects standalone guidance. `79cb07d` retains the previously validated ArchitectureTests boundary
  after its package-specific ACL failure.

## Verification

- Exact-head CI run [`33636812070`](https://github.com/Concertable/customer/actions/runs/33636812070) at
  `79cb07d6dab684a75cba60012374ac76c41c4b0c`: Frontend job `100269619614` passed in 1m59s and
  Backend job `100269619229` passed in 7m14s, including the canonical solution build/tests, seven migration
  snapshots, five-package pack and compile-use consumer closure, three OCI candidates, migration/simulator,
  integrity, and retention gates.
- Retained artifact `9849406524`, `customer-candidate-integrity-4e4aa1c5354da0f1e0af912ba7c5c24865e38aea`,
  expires 2026-10-02 and has digest
  `sha256:06107990940fca0005c5c5eff40eef7aa9c39c627ecfde48bc8ac4629a1ff8e9`.
- Run [`33635705299`](https://github.com/Concertable/customer/actions/runs/33635705299) proved the otherwise
  green canonical solution cannot restore `Concertable.Customer.ArchitectureTests` because Customer lacks
  package-specific access to `Concertable.Testing.Architecture` (`403`). `79cb07d` restored the project's
  prior exclusion from the canonical solution; it did not delete or weaken the architecture tests.
- Actions policy remains `enabled: true`, `allowed_actions: all`, `sha_pinning_required: true`; default
  workflow permissions remain `read` and PR approvals remain disabled. The workflow remains read-only and
  both checkout invocations set `persist-credentials: false`.

## Reviews

  with no findings after verifying connection-name closure, the intentional composition alias, all seven
  module `Schema` owners, and untouched generated migrations. Draft PR #1 still owns the cumulative delivery
  gate before any merge.

## Decisions, discoveries, blockers, and deviations

- Repository ID `1351337130` survived the canonical rename. Reuse
  `C:\Users\tommy\source\repos\customer`; do not create another clone or rewrite private `main`.
- Exact NuGet package ACL closure:
  - `Concertable.AppHost.Shared`
  - `Concertable.Auth.Contracts`
  - `Concertable.B2B.Artist.Contracts`, `Concertable.B2B.Concert.Contracts`, `Concertable.B2B.Seed.Contracts`, `Concertable.B2B.Tenant.Contracts`, `Concertable.B2B.User.Contracts`, `Concertable.B2B.Venue.Contracts`
  - `Concertable.Contracts`
  - `Concertable.DataAccess.Application`, `Concertable.DataAccess.Infrastructure`
  - `Concertable.Grpc`, `Concertable.Kernel`
  - `Concertable.Messaging.Application`, `Concertable.Messaging.AzureServiceBus`, `Concertable.Messaging.Contracts`, `Concertable.Messaging.Domain`, `Concertable.Messaging.Infrastructure`
  - `Concertable.Payment.Client`, `Concertable.Payment.Contracts`
  - `Concertable.Seed.Identity`, `Concertable.Seed.Shared`, `Concertable.ServiceDefaults`
  - `Concertable.Shared.Api`
  - `Concertable.Shared.Blob.Application`, `Concertable.Shared.Blob.Infrastructure`
  - `Concertable.Shared.Email.Application`, `Concertable.Shared.Email.Infrastructure`
  - `Concertable.Shared.Geocoding.Application`, `Concertable.Shared.Geocoding.Infrastructure`
  - `Concertable.Shared.Imaging.Application`, `Concertable.Shared.Imaging.Infrastructure`
  - `Concertable.Shared.Notification.Infrastructure`
  - `Concertable.Shared.Pdf.Application`, `Concertable.Shared.Pdf.Infrastructure`
  - `Concertable.Shared.QrCode.Application`, `Concertable.Shared.QrCode.Infrastructure`
  - `Concertable.Testing`, `Concertable.Testing.Integration`
- Exact npm package ACL closure: `@concertable/mobile`, `@concertable/shared`, `@concertable/web`.
- Current package candidate set: `Concertable.Customer.Hosting`, `Concertable.Customer.Review.Contracts`,
  `Concertable.Customer.Seed.Contracts`, `Concertable.Customer.TestKit`, and
  `Concertable.Customer.Ticket.Contracts`. The Customer-owned candidate roster is complete. Ticket Contracts
  are intentional because Hosting directly uses
  `TicketPurchasedEvent` and `SendTicketEmailCommand`.
- Exact-head CI now creates local Customer Web, `customer-migrations`, and `customer-seed-simulator` archives.
  The simulator smoke uses `docker load` and `docker run --rm` against the built archive; it is not a source-only
  substitute. Runtime `MigrateAsync` remains as a temporary fallback until the standalone AppHost invokes the
  migration resource. No package, image, canonical release, visibility change, deployment, or system-consumer
  update was authorized or performed.
- The organization quota recalculated without Customer deleting another stream's caches. Failed-job rerun
  attempt 3 created the required retained artifact, so the quota blocker is closed.
- Customer now has repository-wide bootstrap `CODEOWNERS` for `@tomjseery`; all workflow actions are pinned to verified immutable SHAs, and repository Actions requires SHA pinning. GitHub still returns the private-plan `Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public` `403` for both repository rulesets and `main` branch protection. Do not bypass or retry that delivery-time capability gate.
- `Concertable.Customer.ArchitectureTests` stays outside `Concertable.Customer.slnx`, matching the prior
  carve solution boundary. Adding it requires the package owner to grant `Concertable/customer` Actions read
  access to `Concertable.Testing.Architecture`; do not replace that package with source or suppress the test.
- The extracted `Concertable.Customer.AppHost` remains excluded from `Concertable.Customer.slnx` and has ten foreign
  monorepo `ProjectReference`s. Invoking the Customer migration resource there and removing runtime
  `MigrateAsync` is not independently buildable or validatable until its foreign container-hosting inputs are
  available. Do not fake that gate or widen this stream into RT3, Stage 4, Auth, Payment, Search, or B2B.
- Vitest invokes Vite with `command = serve` and `mode = test`; development-only configuration must consider
  both values rather than treating every `serve` configuration load as a live dev server.
- A multi-path fold must include support files outside selected app subtrees: Customer's relocated Vite app
  uses `app/.env.production`, and Expo's unchanged `../assets/*` references require `app/assets/`.
- This ledger has no write ownership over the monorepo RT3 or fleet branches.
