# B2B .NET 11 runtime progress

- Plan: `plans/dotnet-11/B2B_WORKFLOW_UNIONS_PLAN.md`
- Roadmap: `plans/dotnet-11/DOTNET_11_ROADMAP.md`
- Roadmap item: `dotnet-11/b2b-workflow-unions`
- Worktree: not created
- Branch: `Refactor/dotnet-11_b2b-runtime`
- Plan PR: #448 merged; historical closeout PR #449 does not authorize implementation
- Dependency/package gates: blocked on terminal delivery of
  `plans/launch/DEAL_LIFECYCLE_OWNERSHIP_PROGRESS.md`
- Downstream dependent: `plans/launch/DEAL_CLOSED_SUM_MODEL_PROGRESS.md` requires the supported C# 15
  native-union/runtime and compiler/target matrix for its method-header and published Deal cut-overs
- Last reconciled: 2026-08-21 against the direct method-header interface-union decision

## Current state

The reserved branch name above has not been created yet. No .NET 11 implementation exists. The previous design proposed unions over concrete workflow step
services. That target is superseded: the lifecycle refactor deletes the cross-stage workflow and gives
Application, Booking, and Concert independent state machines and contextual operations. Native unions
are selected for small closed internal values, beginning with the read-only combined journey
projection and extending only to proven case-specific module states, triggers, and operation outcomes.

The lifecycle plan now owns the net10 `DealUnionBuilder<TUnion>` over the generic keyed-union builder and
`IDealUnionFactory<TUnion>` foundation plus Dunet adapter unions for heterogeneous Apply and Accept. This
runtime plan owns their mechanical replacement with direct native interface unions while preserving the
factory contract and Deal mappings. Honest same-interface terms, mapper, updater, and completion families
remain on `IDealStrategyFactory<TStrategy>`.

The B2B typed-result dependency landed in PR #552. The lifecycle plan owns the return path.

## Next Steps

Blocked: The Application, Booking, and Concert module/state refactor has not completed its delivery lifecycle.
Blocked by: `plans/launch/DEAL_LIFECYCLE_OWNERSHIP_PROGRESS.md`.
Unblock action: The lifecycle owner must land the approved module split and reconcile the required journey-stage union plus case-specific module state, trigger, and operation-outcome candidates against the resulting APIs and target graph. This plan must then record the C# 15 native-union/runtime and closed-hierarchy compiler/target matrix and notify the Deal dispatch ledger when both gates open.
Resume when: Current `main` contains the delivered lifecycle split and the lifecycle ledger records every implementation, review, PR, publication, and platform-sync gate as terminal green.

## Completed work

- Established the B2B runtime/net10 Contracts compatibility boundary and SDK/Functions risks.
- Rejected the cross-stage union over DI operation implementations after the lifecycle ownership decision.
- Replanned this work as a runtime upgrade with native unions for closed internal values; the downstream
  Deal plan owns direct unions of module-owned heterogeneous method-header interfaces.
- Reconciled the landing shape against current C# 15 union semantics: direct interface cases replace the
  net10 Dunet adapter records, while keyed DI remains confined to `IDealUnionFactory<TUnion>`.
- Registered the Deal dispatch/representation plan as a downstream consumer of the supported C# 15
  native-union/runtime and target matrix.

## Verification

- Published B2B Contracts have net10 consumers and cannot become net11-only in this slice.
- Native unions do not resolve keyed services or DI lifetimes.
- No runtime verification applies while the implementation worktree is blocked and absent.

## Reviews

Historical reviews do not approve the superseded workflow-union target. This reconciled plan requires
a fresh docs review before implementation.

## Decisions, discoveries, blockers, and deviations

- The runtime upgrade is the platform gate for native union adoption.
- This plan's native unions model closed values; the journey-stage projection is the first required use.
- The net10 lifecycle foundation uses operation-owned Dunet adapter unions because C# 14 cannot express
  direct interface unions. The .NET 11 replacement is
  `union Accept(IAccept, IAcceptPaid)`, never a union of wrapper records or concrete
  implementations.
- Required invocation input is narrowed with an ordinary `when ... is not null` pattern arm. Its missing
  arm returns the typed Result failure; it does not use a throwing requirement helper or weaken a method
  header to accept nullable input.
- The lifecycle split owns state architecture; the Deal plan owns replacement of its provisional
  selectors after delivery with invariant same-interface factories, method-header unions, direct calls,
  or data. The later public dispatch package may replace their internal keyed implementation.
- The current [C# union reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/union)
  permits interfaces as union cases and defines unions over types, not raw method declarations. Therefore
  the .NET 11 boundary can directly use `IAccept` and `IAcceptPaid` without adapter records.
- [Dunet](https://github.com/domn1995/dunet) requires nested partial-record variants. Those adapters are the
  explicit net10 compatibility boundary for Apply and Accept and are deleted when native interface unions
  become available.
- Published Contracts and persisted/wire models remain union-free in this runtime PR.
- The Deal contract's later closed hierarchy is not a native union and is outside this runtime PR.

## Resume prompt

Not emitted while `## Next Steps` carries the hard-blocker fields. The lifecycle owner opens the gate
and supplies the implementation pointer.
