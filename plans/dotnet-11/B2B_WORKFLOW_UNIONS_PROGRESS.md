# B2B .NET 11 runtime progress

- Plan: `plans/dotnet-11/B2B_WORKFLOW_UNIONS_PLAN.md`
- Roadmap: `plans/dotnet-11/DOTNET_11_ROADMAP.md`
- Roadmap item: `dotnet-11/b2b-workflow-unions`
- Worktree: not created
- Branch: `Refactor/dotnet-11_b2b-runtime`
- Plan PR: #448 merged; historical closeout PR #449 does not authorize implementation
- Dependency/package gates: blocked on terminal delivery of
  `plans/launch/DEAL_LIFECYCLE_OWNERSHIP_PROGRESS.md`
- Downstream dependent: `plans/launch/DEAL_CLOSED_SUM_MODEL_PROGRESS.md` requires the supported C# 15
  native-union/runtime and compiler/target matrix for finite-vocabulary closure and honest-header unions;
  `plans/launch/DEAL_CONFIGURATION_PROGRESS.md` does not depend on this runtime upgrade
- Last reconciled: 2026-09-10 for the configurable-Deal design; lifecycle delivery-gate reconciliation
  remains with its active owner

## Current state

The reserved branch name above has not been created yet. No .NET 11 implementation exists. The previous design proposed unions over concrete workflow step
services. That target is superseded: the lifecycle refactor deletes the cross-stage workflow and gives
Application, Booking, and Concert independent state machines and contextual operations. Native unions
are selected for small closed internal values, beginning with the read-only combined journey
projection and extending only to proven case-specific module states, triggers, and operation outcomes.

Inventory the landed APIs before selecting native-union work. Replace only genuinely heterogeneous
adapter unions; do not restore Apply/Accept unions or mapper/updater families removed by later ownership
and layering work. Configurations select finite capability kinds/versions, not configuration-specific
DI entries. Whole deals become versioned data under the separate configuration plan, not a permanently
closed four-case hierarchy. Genuine same-interface families and module-local ownership remain valid.

The B2B typed-result dependency landed in PR #552. The lifecycle plan owns the return path.

## Next Steps

Blocked: Lifecycle source PR #633 is merged, but this reserved runtime owner still needs the lifecycle owner's terminal delivery/API reconciliation before starting.
Blocked by: `plans/launch/DEAL_LIFECYCLE_OWNERSHIP_PROGRESS.md`.
Unblock action: The lifecycle owner must land the approved module split and reconcile the required journey-stage union plus case-specific module state, trigger, and operation-outcome candidates against the resulting APIs and target graph. This plan must then record the C# 15 native-union/runtime and closed-hierarchy compiler/target matrix and notify the Deal dispatch ledger when both gates open.
Resume when: Current `main` contains the delivered lifecycle split and the lifecycle ledger records every implementation, review, PR, publication, and platform-sync gate as terminal green.

## Completed work

- Established the B2B runtime/net10 Contracts compatibility boundary and SDK/Functions risks.
- Rejected the cross-stage union over DI operation implementations after the lifecycle ownership decision.
- Replanned this work as a runtime upgrade with native unions for closed internal values; the downstream
  Deal plan owns direct unions of module-owned heterogeneous method-header interfaces.
- Reconciled the landing shape against current C# 15 union semantics: direct interface cases replace the
  net10 Dunet adapter records, while keyed DI remains confined to `IDealUnionFactory<TUnion>`.
- Registered the Deal dispatch/representation plan as a downstream consumer of the supported C# 15
  native-union/runtime and target matrix.

## Verification

- Published B2B Contracts have net10 consumers and cannot become net11-only in this slice.
- Native unions do not resolve keyed services or DI lifetimes.
- No runtime verification applies while the implementation worktree is blocked and absent.

## Reviews

Historical reviews do not approve the superseded workflow-union target. This reconciled plan requires
a fresh docs review before implementation.

## Decisions, discoveries, blockers, and deviations

- The runtime upgrade is the platform gate for native union adoption.
- This plan's native unions model closed values; the journey-stage projection is the first required use.
- Where the landed net10 APIs still need operation-owned adapter unions, native unions can replace
  them with direct method-header interfaces. `Accept(IAccept, IAcceptPaid)` is an illustration only;
  homogeneous Apply/Accept operations must remain homogeneous.
- Required invocation input is narrowed with an ordinary `when ... is not null` pattern arm. Its missing
  arm returns the typed Result failure; it does not use a throwing requirement helper or weaken a method
  header to accept nullable input.
- The lifecycle split owns state architecture; the Deal plan owns replacement of its provisional
  selectors after delivery with invariant same-interface factories, method-header unions, direct calls,
  or data. The later public dispatch package may replace their internal keyed implementation.
- The current [C# union reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/union)
  permits interfaces as union cases and defines unions over types, not raw method declarations. Therefore
  the .NET 11 boundary can directly use `IAccept` and `IAcceptPaid` without adapter records.
- [Dunet](https://github.com/domn1995/dunet) uses nested partial-record variants. Replace only adapters
  actually present and justified by the Phase 0 inventory when adopting native interface unions.
- Published Contracts and persisted/wire models remain union-free in this runtime PR.
- The later Deal closure target is finite rule/capability vocabulary, not whole configurations; its
  wire/schema cut-over is outside this runtime PR.

## Resume prompt

Not emitted while `## Next Steps` carries the hard-blocker fields. The lifecycle owner opens the gate
and supplies the implementation pointer.
