# Data-access roadmap

DataAccess repository/base and context-enforcement work for the shared `Concertable.DataAccess`
package and its service consumers.

## Items

- [x] Cosmos-aligned repository facets + context-enforced no-tracking `data-access/repository-redesign`
- [x] EF context/repository permission hierarchy `data-access/repository-context-permission-hierarchy`
  — the capability seam is stable; any package extraction remains separate while Kernel entity and
  messaging couplings are measured.
