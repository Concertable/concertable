# Typed Result migration roadmap

> **Roadmap** for adopting one Reunion-backed `Result` and `Option` vocabulary across every backend
> microservice while keeping Concertable's error unions and HTTP policy application-owned. This is
> the living cross-workstream dependency map, not an implementation plan. Each
> buildable item spins off its own `_PLAN.md` and `_PROGRESS.md`; the roadmap tier is the `plans`
> skill.
>
> **Goal:** replace the temporary Concertable-owned carriers with Reunion, remove third-party Result
> carriers and ambiguous application/module lookup contracts, and keep every service independently
> buildable, deployable, and package-clean.
>
> **Canonical conventions:** [`../../api/agents/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`](../../api/agents/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md)
> “Typed operation Results.” Backend ownership and package rules live in
> [`../../api/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../api/ARCHITECTURE.md).
> Those conventions describe the current published Reunion and platform-sync baseline; the remaining
> cleanup is owned by
> [`REUNION_SHARED_CONTRACTION_PLAN.md`](REUNION_SHARED_CONTRACTION_PLAN.md).
>
> **Latest published producer release:** NuGet.org publishes `0.1.0-alpha.6` for `Reunion`,
> `Reunion.Validation`, `Reunion.Errors`, and `Reunion.AspNetCore`. The merged producer baseline adds
> structured `ValidationResult`, direct static `ErrorDefinition` factories, canonical native-union
> source/API baselines, and target-typed raw-payload plus exact named-case conversions across
> `Result`, `UnitResult`, and `Option`, including flexible projected `Option` HTTP terminals and
> value-preserving validation-aware `Ensure`. Customer Ticket consumes alpha.6; remaining owners
> reconcile their exact published baseline in their own ledgers, and delivery ordering does not block
> independent service code.

## How to continue this roadmap

Run with an optional preferred item after the roadmap path:

```text
$continue-roadmap @plans/typed-result/TYPED_RESULT_MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md [preferred item in natural language]
```

For example, this one-shot invocation selects Customer when it remains ready:

```text
$continue-roadmap @plans/typed-result/TYPED_RESULT_MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md Customer non-Payment outcomes and lookups
```

The skill always classifies every item below against branches, worktrees, PRs, and package gates.
Omit the preference to receive the full list of unblocked and unowned choices. When a supplied
preference is ready, the skill treats it as the choice and directly emits the handoff; when it is
blocked, in flight, or not found, the skill explains why and offers the ready alternatives instead.
The handoff tells a fresh context to write the item's plan and progress ledger; it does not create or
implement the plan itself.

For parallel work, reserve the ready items sequentially: run `$continue-roadmap`, choose one item, and
let its handoff create the worktree/plan before selecting the next item. Once the distinct worktrees
exist, their planning and implementation may run concurrently. Starting several selection contexts
before any creates its worktree leaves a race in which each context can see the same item as unowned.

Every new item uses a sibling worktree and a branch named `Feature/typed-result_<name>` from fresh
`origin/main`, with its plan and ledger under `plans/typed-result/`. Existing legacy-named owners keep
their current branch and worktree rather than fragmenting in-flight work.

## Status

### Foundation — shipped

- [x] ✅ **Owned Kernel Result/Option foundation and Shared.Api terminals.** PR #290 published
  `Result`, `Result<TValue>`, `UnitResult<TError>`, `Result<TValue,TError>`, `Option<T>`, and
  `ValidationErrors`; platform-sync PR #291 delivered them to every service.
- [x] ✅ **Kernel-derived error definitions and natural error-case conventions.** Kernel derives the
  stable code and default humanized message from each named case, with `[ErrorCode]` reserved for
  published-code compatibility. The current convention uses Dunet and one exhaustive `Definition`
  switch for payload-free, payload-carrying, validation, and composite cases. Its canonical form is
  in `api/agents/CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`.

### Service tracks — shipped

- [x] ✅ **Search contract audit and normalization.** PR #380 normalized Search's in-process collection
  contracts to `IReadOnlyList<T>` and added Search-owned architecture enforcement without changing
  transport, projection, failure, or empty-result behavior. Publication and platform-sync PR #388
  delivered `ConcertablePlatformVersion` `0.1.0-alpha.0.827` to every service. A current source audit
  finds no Search functional carrier/error import to convert; do not create invented Search work.
- [x] ✅ **Payment owned-result migration.** PR #392 replaced Payment's published FluentResults client
  surface with Concertable-owned typed Result/Option contracts and preserved reviewed-gross money
  invariants. Platform-sync PR #420 migrated B2B and Customer consumers, merged as `372be1041`, and
  post-merge publication delivered platform `0.1.0-alpha.0.857`. B2B and Auth handoffs are dispatched.

### In flight — existing owners, do not offer or duplicate

- [ ] 🟠 **B2B typed-result migration.** `typed-result/b2b` Exclusive owner: `Refactor/B2BTypedResultMigration` at
  `C:\Users\TommySeery\source\repos\Concertable\.worktrees\Refactor-B2BTypedResultMigration`.
  **Authoritative work is active and unpushed in the recorded local worktree as of 2026-08-09.**
  GitHub remains an incomplete inventory because no branch PR or remote branch exists.
  Payment-independent checkpoints 1-5 are complete. Payment PR #392, platform-sync PR #420, and
  platform `0.1.0-alpha.0.857` discharged the old package gate; checkpoints 6-7 own Concert
  payment/cancel/finish workflows and final B2B FluentResults removal. Those checkpoints are
  implementable now against exact Payment packages from `a779fe041`; publication and generated sync
  gate delivery and final revalidation, not local preparation.
  Before the next B2B checkpoint commit, align every direct Reunion reference to `0.1.0-alpha.2` and
  use the new construction surface where it keeps the owned error union explicit.
- [x] ✅ **B2B Payment saga producer.** `typed-result/b2b-payment-saga-producer` delivered Payment PR
  #544 as `d6619a856`, published platform `0.1.0-alpha.0.973`, and completed cumulative platform-sync
  PR #547 as `7bd956499`. The B2B consumer now owns final current-main/package revalidation.
- [x] ✅ **Customer Ticket purchase/checkout slice.** `typed-result/customer-ticket-reunion` PR #475
  delivered typed Ticket outcomes; PR #540 completed Option boundaries, cancellation propagation,
  package ownership, and focused coverage; PR #555 adopted validation-aware `Ensure` on Reunion
  `0.1.0-alpha.6`. Publication succeeded and platform-sync PR #564 delivered platform
  `0.1.0-alpha.0.985` as `3ae425616` with all PR and merge-group gates green.

- [x] ✅ **Customer non-Payment outcomes and lookups.** `typed-result/customer-outcomes` PR #425
  migrated Review, Preference, User, Venue, and Artist to operation-owned Results, structured
  validation, application/service Options, and materialized lists on the published Reunion
  `0.1.0-alpha.3` family. Full merge-queue API/UI E2E passed; the PR merged as `9c3192066`, package
  publication succeeded, and platform-sync PR #535 delivered platform `0.1.0-alpha.0.963` as
  `8249fa5c9` with its build, carve, unit, and integration gates green.

- [x] ✅ **Auth expected-outcome migration.** `typed-result/auth-outcomes` PR #517 migrated Auth's
  ordinary absence and caller-actionable refusals to published Reunion `Option<T>` and owned typed
  results while preserving Razor, Duende, privacy, and exception boundaries. Full API/UI E2E passed;
  publication delivered platform `0.1.0-alpha.0.958`, and platform-sync PR #531 merged terminal green.

### Selected cross-cutting track — one owner, never duplicated on service PRs

- [ ] 🟢 **Reunion alpha.2 package baseline.** `typed-result/reunion-alpha2-baseline` Align every
  existing Concertable Reunion package pin to `0.1.0-alpha.2` through
  [`REUNION_ALPHA2_BASELINE_PLAN.md`](REUNION_ALPHA2_BASELINE_PLAN.md) and
  [`REUNION_ALPHA2_BASELINE_PROGRESS.md`](REUNION_ALPHA2_BASELINE_PROGRESS.md). This owns the
  repository-wide package-version cutover and its publication/platform-sync lifecycle, not service
  semantics or unused package additions. Active service owners may prepare their own alpha.2 code now.

- [x] ✅ **Reunion package integration and Payment carrier cutover.**
  `typed-result/reunion-integration` PR #453, platform-sync PR #463, and domain-outcome follow-up PR
  #470 are merged. The current producer baseline is the four-package alpha.3 family. B2B remains an
  independently owned consumer track; the final Shared contraction is
  owned only by `typed-result/reunion-shared-contraction`.

- [x] 🟢 **HTTP terminal ownership resolved upstream.** `Reunion.AspNetCore` already publishes the MVC
  and Minimal API Result/Option terminals, generic success mappers, ProblemDetails execution, and
  structured validation mapping. Retire `Refactor/typed-result_http-terminals` without publication;
  each service HTTP edge consumes the Reunion adapter directly during its carrier migration.

### Parallel preparation dispatched

B2B and the alpha.2 package-baseline owner have independently executable ledgers; both Customer tracks
are terminal, with the Ticket correction synchronized on platform `.985`.
`REUNION_SHARED_CONTRACTION_PLAN.md` owns the final contraction but remains implementation-blocked
until the remaining prepared consumer set and exact remaining-call-site inventory exist.

### Blocked follow-ups

- [ ] 🔴 **Domain outcome and invariant-exception audit.** Auth and both Customer tracks are terminal
  on published Reunion baselines; plan after B2B is also terminal, and complete it before final
  repository cleanup. Inventory every production `DomainException`
  throw/guard and every domain
  operation or factory that can reject work.
  - Expected domain alternatives that a caller can act on return an operation-owned typed Result from
    the domain method/factory that owns the rule; do not duplicate the rule as an application-service
    pre-check followed by an equivalent throwing entity guard.
  - Malformed internal construction, cross-aggregate identity mismatches, impossible state, and other
    programmer/corruption defects remain exceptions. Do not manufacture Results for those faults or
    catch them in Result combinators.
  - Expected error unions and `ErrorDefinition` own stable public codes/messages. Replace the ambiguous
    blanket `DomainException` to HTTP 400 behavior with an explicit distinction in which expected
    refusals terminate through typed Results and invariant defects remain non-public 500 failures.
  - Add exhaustive inventory, domain behavior, HTTP mapping, and architecture enforcement so every
    surviving domain exception is classified and expected business refusals cannot regress to throws.
- [ ] 🔴 **Shared Kernel, Messaging, and background-path audit.** `typed-result/reunion-shared-contraction` Plan only after the service tracks
  establish concrete remaining call sites. Service plans consume the published Kernel API as-is; a
  genuinely missing shared operation becomes its own additive Kernel publish/sync item rather than
  three service-local variants.
- [ ] 🔴 **Repository cleanup and architecture enforcement.** Blocked until B2B is complete and the
  domain outcome/invariant audit has landed. Remove the remaining
  third-party Result dependencies and compatibility surfaces, then enforce: no third-party
  Result/Option in public signatures, no nullable non-persistence single-item application/module/client
  lookups, no `Option`-wrapped collections, no Result on wire DTOs, and no controller-local typed-error
  status switches.
- [ ] 🔴 **Released .NET native-union error cutover.** Blocked until Concertable upgrades from net10.0
  to the released .NET/C# toolchain that supports the required union semantics. Reunion already
  supplies conventional union-compatible net10 assets and native net11 carrier support; this item is
  about Concertable-owned domain error unions, not replacing Reunion's Result family.
  - Replace each Dunet error declaration with the idiomatic released native declaration; retain the
    exhaustive `Definition` switch and preserve case names, payloads, definitions, published
    codes/messages/kinds, transport mappers, and contract tests. Keep `Definition` as a computed
    instance member when the released union syntax permits it; use an extension only if the final
    language design requires one.
  - Remove Dunet attributes, generated inheritance, and package references only after every error
    union compiles natively. The open-string wire reverse map remains a dictionary because no closed
    union can make a future transport string exhaustive.
  - Measure the released representation before changing generic constraints: Dunet cases are
    reference records today, while converting a native value union to `IError` or `object` may box.
    Keep operation and transport paths concretely typed as `TError` and use `IError` primarily as a
    definition constraint.
  - Decide separately whether the released native semantics improve on Kernel's owned Result/Option
    carriers. Replacing those carriers is not a prerequisite for migrating error unions.

```

B2B has authoritative unpushed local work that is now inventoried. Preserve its worktree; remote state
alone remains insufficient. Service diffs remain service-owned, and temporary package inputs never
become committed delivery configuration.

## Shared migration rules

- Reunion `Result` and `Option` are in-process contracts only. HTTP, protobuf, events, persistence,
  and other wire boundaries retain owned transport contracts and map at the service edge.
- Every project directly owns the Reunion package whose API its source compiles against. Core and
  typed-error use takes direct `Reunion`/`Reunion.Errors` references; each service API/Web project
  mapping carriers takes `Reunion.AspNetCore`. Shared.Api neither distributes the adapter nor defines
  duplicate Result/Option HTTP terminals. Domain error unions and published semantics remain
  application-owned.
- Every direct reference to `Reunion`, `Reunion.Validation`, `Reunion.Errors`, or
  `Reunion.AspNetCore` uses one exact published family baseline within its owning migration. Do not
  mix family versions or add a package to a project that does not compile against its API.
- Use target-typed raw payload conversions only where success/error intent is unambiguous. Use exact
  named `Success`/`Failure`/`Some`/`None` cases where payload types overlap or branch intent matters;
  use direct static factories when inference would obscure the contract. Ambiguous conversions must
  fail at compile time rather than being hidden by helper shims.
- Expected caller-actionable refusals use typed Results, including inside domain entities and factories
  when rejection is a normal domain alternative. The owning domain method enforces the rule once and
  the application layer maps its typed outcome; do not pre-check the same rule merely to avoid a
  throwing domain guard.
- Infrastructure failures, cancellation, malformed internal construction, and programmer/invariant
  defects remain exceptions. Do not catch them in Result combinators or expose their messages as
  expected API contracts; `ErrorDefinition` owns stable public codes and messages.
- Repository single-item lookups may remain nullable as a persistence concern. Application, module,
  service, and published client boundaries convert ordinary absence to `Option<T>`; collections return
  empty `IReadOnlyList<T>` values.
- Result/Option changes do not justify cross-service runtime references. Every service must build from
  its own published package closure and pass its standalone carve.
- A service plan may not expand the public Kernel API opportunistically. Record a concrete missing
  operation as a separate shared roadmap item, publish it additively, and wait for platform sync before
  consuming it.
- Every published Kernel, Payment, or Contracts change owns the complete merge → publish → platform
  sync → consumer migration sequence. Never leave a red platform-sync PR behind.
- Reunion package/carrier changes land once in their owning integration branches. Existing service
  migration PRs merge the integrated baseline and resolve semantic conflicts; they do not carry
  duplicate package pins, copied carriers, or HTTP adapter replacements.
- The final cleanup is the only removal point for compatibility surfaces still needed by another
  branch. Parallel service branches remove dependencies only from their own completed closures.

## Epic definition of done

- Every backend service uses Reunion's complete Result/Option family consistently at in-process
  boundaries, without removing or collapsing any Result family.
- No Concertable project remains on a mixed Reunion-family package graph.
- Every service’s unit/integration gates, Release solution build, architecture tests, and standalone
  carve pass on the published package closure.
- Payment, B2B, and Customer package cutovers and platform-sync PRs are terminal and green.
- Repository-wide inventories find no FluentResults/CSharpFunctionalExtensions production use,
  third-party Result/Option public signatures, nullable non-persistence single-item lookup contracts,
  Option-wrapped collections, or Result-bearing wire DTOs.
- Every production domain exception is classified: expected domain alternatives return typed Results,
  genuine invariant defects remain exceptions, and no service duplicates a domain rule as pre-check
  plus throw.
- Expected domain refusals terminate through `ErrorDefinition`; invariant defects are non-public 500
  failures and are never blanket-mapped to HTTP 4xx.
- Architecture enforcement prevents those contracts from returning.
- The released native-union error cutover is complete and Dunet is removed.
